            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no treaſure ſo much enriches the minde of man as learning; there is no learning ſo proper for the direction of the life of man as Hiſtore; there is no hiſtorie (I ſpeake onelie of profate) ſo well worth the reading as Tacitus. For learning nature acknowledgeth a reaſon, by leauing induſtrie to finiſh her vnperfect worke: for without learning the conceyte is like a fruitefull ſoyle without tilling, the memorie like a ſtorehouſe without wares, the will like a ſhippe without a rudder. For Hiſtorie, ſince we are eaſſier taught by example the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by precept, what ſtudie can profit vs ſo much, as that which giues vs patternes either to follow or to flye,, of the beſt and worſt men of all eſtates, cuntries, and times that euer were? For Tacitus I may ſay without partiality, that hee hath writen the moſt matter with beſt conceyt in feweſt wordes of anie Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher ancient or moderne. But he is harde. <hi>Difficilia quae pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra:</hi> the ſecond reading ouer will pleaſe thee more then the firſt, and the third then the ſecond. And if thy ſtomacke be ſo tender as thou canſt not diſgeſt Tacitus in his owne ſtile, thou art beholding to Sauile, who giues thee the ſame foode, but with a pleaſant and eaſie taſte. In theſe fower bookes of the ſtorie thou ſhalt ſee all the miſeries of a torne and declining ſtate: The Empire vſurped; the Princes murthered; the people wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering; the ſouldiers tumultuous; nothing vnlawfull to him that hath power, and nothing ſo vnſafe as to bee ſecurely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. In Galba thou maieſt learne, that a good Prince gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by euill miniſters is as dangerous as if hee were euill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. By Otho, that the fortune of a raſh man is <hi>Torrenti ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which riſes at an inſtant, and falles in a moment. By Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, that he that hath no vertue can neuer bee happy: for by his owne baſeneſſe hee will looſe all, which eyther fortune, or other mens labours haue caſt vpon him. By Veſpaſian, that in ciuill tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults an aduiſed patience, and opportunitie well taken are the onelie weapons of aduantage.

Then he ordeined a counſell in forme of a Senate elected out of the chiefeſt and graueſt men of his traine, and a garde of young gentlemen to watch and warde at his lodging, he publiſheth edicts, &amp; ſendes them abroade to euery prouince, exhorting them all to take armes, &amp; concurre in common againſt the common enemie.

A fit man they needed not ſeeke farre off: Verginius Rufus the Lieutenant, though of a gentlemans houſe, and no higher, in ſtrength of bodie, matters of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all other things excelled Galba. in birth what if Galba were better? Catulus the toppe of his kinne fled diſhonourablie awaie in the Cimbrian vvarre, vvhere Marius, baſelier borne then Verginius, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie ſtucke to it, and ſaued the ſtate.

Thus departing as frendes, ech to his campe, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>index ſecure as in a quarrell alreadie compoſed, and nothing attending leſſe then the ſhocke, meaning to enter the towne, and repoſe his armie, with all his men made towards the gates.

Vindex ſeeing the vnluckie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this vnlooked for battaile, hauing loſt in a maner the flowre of all France, &amp; ſuſpecting fraude of Verginius ſide, as though he ment to entrappe him, and ſende him to Nero, ranne himſelfe vpon his owne ſworde. manie comming after beſtowed their blowes vpon the dead carcaſe, ſeeking a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for praiſe or rewarde if Nero preuailed. After this ſlaughter, the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers preſſed Verginius againe to accept of the Empire, and embaſſages came almoſt from euery quarter requiring the ſame, with aſſured promiſe of all poſſible aſſiſtance, if not, readie to returne to Neroes obedience: but Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginius bewailing the heauie miſhappe of his vnfortunate frende, reiecteth the ſpeech, &amp; marcheth forward in France. This ende had Iulius Vindex, a man in the courſe of this action more vertuous then fortunate; who hauing no armie prouided, no legion, no ſouldier in charge, whiles others more able lookt on, first entred the liſts, chalenging a Prince vpholden with thirty le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, rooted in the Empire by fower deſcents of anceſtours, and fourteene yeares continuance of raigne, not vpon priuate diſpaire to ſet in combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtate, not to reuenge diſgrace or diſhonour, not to eſtabliſh his owne ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignety, things which haue mooued most men to attempt; but to redeeme his cuntrey from tyranny and bondage, which onely reſpect he regarded ſo much, that in reſpect he regarded nothing his owne life or ſecurity. For when it was ſhewed him, that Nero by publicke edict had prized his heade at<note n="a" place="margin">That is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound.</note> ten thouſand thouſand ſeſterces; Well, quoth he againe, and he that killes Nero, and brings me his head, ſhall haue mine in exchange. And though in this action fortune gaue vertue the checke, and by a ſtrange accident, which mans wiſedome could not foreſee, ouerturned the enterpriſe, yet muſt wee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18156:7"/> confeſse, that vindex first ſtirred the ſtone, vvhich rowling along tumbled Nero out of his ſeate.</p>
            <p>Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>index reuolt the firſt newes came to Nero at Naples, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the twentieth of Marche: vvhereof hee made ſhewe ſo lightlie to ſet, that hee vvould not vouchſafe once to intermitte his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med pastimes and pleaſures, but rather ſeemed to reioice, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the occaſion, as falling out fittlie to conuert to his cofers by the law of armes the ſpoile of ſo large and ſo welthy a cuntrey: at ſupper alſo receiuing more letters of freſher aduiſe, and certainer danger, he wiſhed them onelie ill chance, which thus by rebelling had troubled his drincking, and ſo for eight daies hee neither wrote letter, nor gaue out order for anie diſpatch. At length through Vindex edicts, ſo thicke and ſo biting, beeing awaked, hee warned the Senate by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to auenge his cauſe, and the common wealthes, excuſing his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by reaſon of ſickneſse. In Vindex edicts, ſupporting the rest patientlie, one thing aboue all troubled him most, that his skill was impeached in playing: wherein hee thought ſurelie there was not his peere; eft ſoones demaunding of them about him, whether, without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, they knew anie in that profeſſion more skilfull then him. by this then ſo manifeſt an vntrueth, in an arte that hee had ſo painfullie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, ſo perfittlie learned, hee vvilled them to esteeme of the reſt. The Senate, receiuing the letters, flattering and fearing, adiudged Vindex a traitour, the ſelfe ſame men which ſoone after beſtowed the like vpon Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro. But vrged by newes vpon newes, at laſt in a fright hee repaired to Rome: vvhere not calling Senate, nor people together, but ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall men to the Palace at an vnſeaſonable houre of the night, as to conſult of vrgent affaires, hee ſhewed them certaine conceits, and new ſtrange deuiſes of muſicke by vvater inſtruments, diſcourſing of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and difficultie of eche, and that hee had founde out a waie to make them ſounde both ſweeter and lowder, and ſhortlie ment to produce them in ſtage, if <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>index vvould giue him leyſure to doe it. But hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Galba and Spaine had rebelled, hee tare his clothes, beat his head, and vvould in no wiſe receiue anie comfort, till ſuch time as the Senate by decree had declared Galba enemie to the ſtate. Then reſuming courage, and ſomewhat reuiued vvith ſome rumours out of Germanie, hee returned to his ryot and careleſſe licentious life, and putting Galbaes ſeruants in priſon ſeized his goods and ſet them to ſale. The like did Galba with Neroes in Spaine, and founde a greate deale more readie chapmen.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:18156:8"/>
            <p>Anone as the tumult beganne, it is ſuppoſed crediblie, that Nero had purpoſed to haue made awaie all the gouernours of armies and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces as being conſpired againſt him; to murder all exiled perſons, leſt they ſhould ioyne themſelues with the rebels; all French hee could finde in the Cittie, as being frendes to the cauſe; to poyſon the Senate in banquet; to ſet a fire the citty, turning in wilde beaſtes among them which endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſtoppe the courſe of the flame. But ſetting apart the deuiſe, not as diſliking, being ſo ſuteable to his proceeding, but as deſpairing to bring it about, hee determined a voyage in perſon, ſending before in the meane ſeaſon Petronius Turpilianus, and Rubrius Gallus vvith certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against them. To furniſh the iourneie his chieffe prouiſion conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in cariage for playing furniture, in concubines ſhorne and polled as men, armed vvith hatchet and target according to the Amazonian faſhion. For muſtering of men there vvere but fewe able enrolled and moſt of them bondmen. Money vvas hardlie and vvith much adoe a little extorted. For vvhereas in time of ciuill ſedition moſt neede is of money, and a vviſe Prince vvill least grieue the ſubiect with new impoſition, as ſeeming to ſtande in ſome ſort at his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and hauing to employ his bodie beſide, Nero, in peace no ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for vvarre, was forced then to offende, vvhen hee ſhould in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon haue ſought to haue vvunne, and yet raiſed leſſe vvith more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition then euer, reputation now vvaining, a contrarie faction beeing one foote. As for pollicies, and plots of vvarre, hee tolde his familiar frendes, hee had one most aſſured. Aſsoone as hee entred the prouince, hee vvould venture himſelfe vnarmed amongſt them, and vvith ſilence and teares mooue them to compaſſion, and ſo they returning to former obedience vvithout more adoe, hee would the next daie merilie ſing, in that merie companie, ſonnets of victorie, which hee willed to bee compoſed out of hand againſt the time came.</p>
            <p>As Nero was thus buſilie occupyed in making prouiſion for the vvarre against Galba and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>index, letters were brought in at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erginius defection, and the reſt of the armies. VVhereupon in a deſperate rage, hee tare the letters, ouerturned the table, daſht two cuppes on the grounde, which hee dearelie esteemed, and caſting awaie all care of himſelfe, notwithstanding the perill preſsed no nearer, hee called for poyſon, which hee put vp in a golden box, that his death at the least might bee according to his eſtate, and ſo walked forth into the Seruilian gardens. From thence hee ſent of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18156:8"/> truſtie ſeruants to Oſtia to make readie the ſhippes, purpoſing to haue fled with his frendes into Aegypt, and there to haue taken himſelfe to his muſicke to get him a liuing: ſottiſhlie ſuppoſing in Aegypt an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſurety to himſelfe by his muſicke, when he could not liue ſafelie Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at Rome. To that purpoſe ſounding the mindes of the Tribunes and Centurions of the Garde, and finding them ſome to drawe backe, ſome flattlie refuſe to goe with him, one among others direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to tell him, that ſure his best waie were to make an ende of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee was diſtracted into diuerſe opinions, casting about what courſe he ſhould follow. flee to the Parthian, whom of late hee had pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? to Galba, who peraduenture might pittie his estate? or were it els better in lamentable ſort and mourning weede to goe out abroad, and in the Place of common aſſemblie, moſt humblie for that which was past de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande pardon: or if he could not obtaine it, that at leaſt they would grant him the gouernement of Aegypt. This liked him beſt, and thereof he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a ſpeech, which afterwards was founde in his papers: but fearing the people would pull him in pieces before he came to the Place, he differred the matter till the next morning.</p>
            <p>Nymphidius Sabinus and Sophonius Tigellinus vvere captaines of the Garde, preferred by Nero from nothing to that honourable place, and now the firſt to forſake him. But Tigellinus, as a perſon infamous and generallie hated, preuailed not much: Sabinus had the credit vvith the ſouldier. vvho affirming that Nero vvas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie fled into AEgypt, and promiſing donatiue in Galbaes name<note n="*" place="margin">234.<hi rend="sup">lib</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

Their fellowes which warded that night foreſeeing the iſſue, and coueting in this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Prince a part with the reſt, left Nero a ſleepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the garden. VVho being awaked about midnight, vnderſtanding his garde vvas departed, leapt out of his bed, and ſent about for his frendes: from vvhom receiuing no anſwere, hee vvith a fewe vvent to their lodgings himſelfe. The great Monarch of the world, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red erewhile as a god, attended vpon and garded by thouſands of frendes, of ſouldiers, of ſeruants, now as a page knocking at dores findeth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18156:9"/> all ſhutte againſt his vnfortunate state. Thus in aduerſitie destitute of ayde, of counſell or comforte of frendes, he returneth home, where finding his chamber rifled, the chamberlaines fled, his box of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon remooued awaie, he ſought for Spicillus the<note n="“" place="margin">Gladiator.</note> fencer or ſome of his ſorte, by vvhoſe handes hee might be diſpatched: and finding none, vvanting alike both frendes and foes, hee ranne deſperatelie out, as though hee would haue throwen himſelfe headlong into the Tiber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but his hart fayling hee repreſſed his pace, and thereupon requiring ſome ſecrete place to recall his wittes, and reſume courage againe, Phaon his freedman offered his houſe foure miles of in the cuntrey, vvhich Nero accepted; and ſo accompanied with foure men onelie, Phaon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epaphroditus, Sporus and Neophytus fleeth awaie, badlie apparrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and vvorſe mounted, couering his head, and hiding his face with a handkercheffe. As hee was in his waie out of the Cittie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching the campe of the Garde, hee heard the ſouldiers ſhowting and vviſhing good lucke vnto Galba, and ill to himſelfe. Jn riding along his horſe ſtarting aſide his face was diſcouered, and hee knowen and ſaluted by one of the Garde vvhich met him by chance. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon forſaking horſe and high vvaie, through buſhes and breres he crept in at the last into a thicket of reedes on the backside of Phaons ferme-houſe, who perſwading Nero in the meane while to ſit in a pitte, out of the vvhich ſande had beene digged, hee refuſed the fauour, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to goe aliue vnder ground, and ſo cast himſelfe downe cloſe in the reedes, till they had beaten a hole in the wall, through which Nero vpon all foure crept into the backside, casting himſelfe vpon a ſimple pallet in a backe roome.</p>
            <p>VVhileſt Nero thus lurcked, the Senate aſſembled in counſaile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him enemie of the state and puniſhable <hi>more maiorum,</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out to ſeeke him and bring him aliue. Concerning the choiſe of a new, although in their ſecrete opinions Verginius deſerued to reſume the benefite which hee had put into their handes, yet beeing not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter into further troubles, and raiſe vp a new ciuill warre, vvithout vvhich Galba, who had alreadie foreprized the place could not bee ſette downe, following the ſouldiers example they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie agreed all vpon Galba. By this time they about Nero were inſtant vpon him to rid himſelfe quickelie out of the contumelies and indignities, which anone he ſhould be forced to endure. To whom yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe hee commandes to make readie for the funeralles, vvee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and vvailing at euerie vvord, vvhat great pitie it was, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18156:9"/> ſo good a minſtrell ſhould bee ſo caſt awaie. Jn the meane ſeaſon, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine letters vvhich vvere brought to Phaon from Rome he ſnatched awaie, and finding therein the Senates decree demaunded vvhat <hi>more maiorum</hi> ment, for that peece of law hee had neuer peruſed: vnderſtanding it was, that his necke ſhould be locked in a forke, and himſelfe vvhipped naked to death, hauing in horrour ſo ſhamefull an ende, hee tooke vp two rapiers vvhich hee had brought with him, and trying their pointes how ſharpe they were, put them vp againe, deſiring ſome of them to beginne and ſhewe him the vvaie to bee man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but deſiring a vertuous example out of ſo vicious a ſchoole, a court ſo corrupt, hee deſired in vaine. And now the horſemen ſent by the Senate approched, vvhich Nero perceiuing, by feare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged ranne himſelfe thorow, Epaphroditus his Secretarie at his requeſt helping to diſpatch him the ſooner, for vvhich ſeruice he was afterward put to death by Domitian: who thought it not meete to ſuffer anie to liue, which had in anie ſort lent his hand to the death of a Prince. Thus Nero, a Prince in life contemptible, and hatefull in gouernement, hauing thereby diſarmed himſelfe both of the loue and feare of his ſubiects, ended his daies the eightth of Iune in the one and thirtieth yeare of his age, and fourteenth of his Empire, at the first ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ruled the state with reaſonable liking, inſomuch that Traian was wonted to ſaie, that euen good Princes were ſhort of Neroes fiue yeares: but after breaking forth into all infamous behauiour, and deteſtable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and cruelties, and beeing withall a Prince weake in action, not of vertue ſufficient to vpholde his vices by might, he was at the length thus ouerthrowen.</p>
            <p>Nero beeing ſlaine, the people and Gentlemen, but principallie the nobilitie, the principall obiect of tyrannie, ſacrificed to the gods and feasted for ioie: ſome alſo ware Bonnets, as beeing newlie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed. The Senate aſsembled againe decreeth thankes to Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidius in most exquiſite maner, extolling his high vviſedome and tender care ouer the state: confirmeth to Galba all princelie prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues and imperiall tiles; making thereof a publicke inſtrument, which the Conſuls ſent him in post: and moreouer concludeth vpon a ſolemne embaſsage of honourable perſonages vvith instructions, beſide congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations and complementes, humblie to deſire vvith ſpeede his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at Rome. Then vvas it propoſed, that information might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede againſt the accuſers. The matter concerned ſome mightie men, vvhich had liued in times paſt by the loſse of their neighbours, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18156:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> touched ſomevvhat a ſecrete of ſtate ouerthrowing and aboliſhing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Empire. Notwithſtanding their doings were ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, and the memorie of their malice ſo freſh, that the order paſſed by voices in Senate, making them all, with the reſt of the miniſters of Neroes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, puniſhable <hi>more maiorum:</hi> but was executed onelie againſt ſome baſe perſons, which had gained but little, &amp; done little harme: the principal malefactours brake thorow vvell enough and eſcaped the danger.</p>
            <p>While matters thus paſsed in France and at Rome, in Spaine Galbaes ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in part were in termes to forſake him, and hardly reclaimed. About the ſame time alſo a freedman of Nero had beſtowed vpon Galba a preſent of bondmen prepared for a practiſe: who according to their inſtructions wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching opportunities, as Galba by a narrow paſſage entred the bath, vſing their toungs, when time was, for hands, and exhorting one another not to let ſlippe the occaſion, were ſodainlie apprehended, and being examined what occaſion they ment, and put to the racke confeſſed the treaſon. Anone after theſe hazards ſo hardly eſcaped, the newes came to Galba of Vindex death, and that vpon ſo great a victorie moſt men vvere vvilling Verginius ſhould take the Empire vpon him, or els would returne to Nero againe. Galba ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremelie afraide writes to Verginius, beſeeching him moſt inſtantly to ioine in defence of the libertie and Empire of Rome: himſelfe notwithſtanding as deſtitute and forlorne, and wearie of the world that vvent ſo againſt him, leauing Vinius Lieutenant in the armie, retireth to Clunia, repenting of that hee had done, and wiſhing againe his priuate eſtate, as though in this caſe there were anie meane betweene hieſt and nothing. Thus being diſtreſſed and anguiſht in minde without any care of himſelfe or the cauſe, in very good ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon comes Icelus his freedman from Rome in ſeuen daies thither, reporting that Nero being yet aliue, but not to be founde, the ſoldier, the Senate &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had pronounced Galba Prince, that ſtraight thereupon Nero was ſaied to bee ſlaine, but himſelfe not beleeuing it went to the place, ſaw him lie dead, and ſo came his way. Two daies after Vinius came from the campe, declaring to him the particular points of the Senates decree. Galba receiuing the newes with great ioy, as greatly aboue expectation, priuiledgeth Icelus to weare golde rings, aduanceth Vinius to chiefe place in credit about him: and laying aſide the name of Lieutenant, aſsumeth the title of Caeſar, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Cornelius Laco to be captaine of his garde, &amp; iudging his preſence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary to ſettle the ſtate, giueth out order for his viage to Rome with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by lande.</p>
            <p>Now at Rome Nymphidius making his count that Neroes fall was his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deede, that no reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence is ſufficient for beſtowing the diademe but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ademe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18156:10"/> that Galba was olde, &amp; ſcarce could laſt out in a litter to Rome, not by degrees, but with a maine courſe drew all to himſelfe. The Garde in reſpect of their donatiue, were at his deuotion, to bee employed as he ſhould direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Lords of the Senate courted him daily, &amp; ſeemed to depend wholly vpon him. VVhereupon vſurping autority vndue to his place, he commands by &amp; by Tigellinus his companion to put off his ſworde and ſurceaſe from his office. The Conſuls vpon a diſpleaſure, that they had ſent the publicke patents not by his ſouldiers, nor ſigned with his ſeale, the curriers commiſſion, he had once determined to haue depriued. And laying the plot for himſelfe he biddeth to ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet the principal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the City: he ſettes vnder hand to put in the ſoldiers heads to preſent ſupplication to Galba, to eſtabliſh Nymphidius captaine for life without any fellowe. To pleaſure the people &amp; get the good wil of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he permittes them to vex &amp; torment whom they could catch of Neroes crew. Spicillus the<note n="“" place="margin">Gladiator.</note> fencer they tied vnder the images of Nero, trailed him along thorow the ſtreetes, and diſpatcht him in the Place of publicke aſſembly. Aponius an accuſer, they ouerthrew, and drew cartes laden vvith ſtones o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his bodie, beſide manie other outraged and ſlaine, and ſome, as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth where the reine is let looſe to the furious multitude, innocently: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in Senate a graue &amp; honourable counſeller openlie proteſted, that in ſhort time there would be great cauſe to wiſh Nero againe, as beeing more tolerable one tiranne then manie, and better to liue vvhere nothing then there vvhere al things were lawful. Thus Nimphidius, ſonne to Nimphidia a libertine an olde ſeruant in court and Martianus a fencer, ſecretelie aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Empire, vvorking in Rome by certaine gratious vvomen and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours, and ſending to Spaine Gellianus one of his frendes to eſpie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and actions of Galba.</p>
            <p>Macer in Africke, the ſtate being troubled, muſtered men, and pretended for himſelfe: but being for auarice and cruelty hated extremely, and finding no followers, could neither maintaine it vvith ſtrength nor leaue it vvith ſafetie. Galuia Criſpinilla Neroes ſchoolemiſtreſse in matter of pleaſure and luſt, when Nero was dead, miſdoubting miſchances, ſailed into Africke, by her aduiſe Macer beſet the ſea coaſts, and forbad any corne ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ported, meaning to famiſh the cittie of Rome. Fonteius Capito, Lieutenant of lowe Germany, ſome thought had a meaning alſo for himſelfe. Certaine it is that ſitting in iudgement, the party aggrieued appealing to Caeſar, he skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the ſeat where he ſat, into a chaire of eſtate ſet vp on high, and then bad him tel on his tale before Caeſar. But Fabius Valens, Lieutenant there of a Legion, then greatly befrending Galbaes part, ſware to him firſt hee with his companie, and the reſt of the armie followed the example. Verginius,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18156:11"/> the onelie concurrent of Galba in ſpeech of the people, hauing ouerthrowen <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>index and maſtered France, notwithſtanding his ſoldiers, after the death of Nero vvas knowen, preſſed him againe in ſuch vehement ſort, that one of the Tribunes drawing his ſworde willed him to accept of it or the Empire, perſiſted conſtantlie in his firſt reſolution: and receauing anone aduiſe of the Senates decree, himſelfe moſt willinglie, his ſouldiers hardlie, &amp; vvith much adoe were perſwaded, ſith lower Germanie had ſworne to ſweare allegeance to Galba. The reſt of the prouinces without anie difficultie accepted him all.</p>
            <p>Now Galba diſpoſing as Prince the affaires of the Empire, fineth the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Spaine, which were not ſo forward to further the cauſe, and ſome he diſmantelleth: certaine Procuratours and officers he putteth to death, their vviues and their children, a crueltie practiſed no not by Nero, much leſſe expected in Galbaes beginnings. He directeth out warrant to Trebonius Garrucianus Procuratour of Africa to put Macer to death, diſmiſſe the Legion lately muſtered, and quiet the cuntrey: and appointes in Verginius place Hordeonius Flaccus Lieutenant in Germanie. Then without coat-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on backe a ſicklie olde man, himſelfe &amp; his men in warlike order march ouer the mountaines. The citties of France that tooke part againſt Vindex he puniſheth with loſse of reuenew and cuntrey: the reſt were relieued, their tributes a quarter abated, themſelues made cittizens of Rome by meanes of their money, and Vinius; vvho carying an ill minde, and ſeruing in great place a weake maſter, made open ſale of his Princes free graces and fauours. At Narbon the embaſſadours ſent from the Senate met him in duetifull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whom Galba receaued curteouſlie with frendly and familiar ſpeeches, and feaſted in ſober ſort all with his owne, though otherwiſe hee had plentie there of Neroes vvaiters and ſeruice ſent by Nymphidius. But anone Vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, vvhich vvhollie poſſeſſed and gouerned the olde man, counſailed him to put of popularity, as not beſeeming his place, to accept of Neroes prouiſion, &amp; to become royall in expenſe and ſeruice. Verginius hauing deliuered the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to his ſucceſſour met Galba on the waie, receiued of him not as in diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and yet vvith ſmall honour ſo dangerous a point it is yea to haue but onelie refuſed the Empire.</p>
            <p>At Gellianus returne Nymphidius hearing that Laco was captaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, that Vinius had all the autoritie and credit, that his meſſenger was ſuſpected and watched of all, not ſuffred to talke with the Prince in priuate, not once to approch to his perſon, was wonderfullie moued in minde. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſsembling the chiefe of the Garde, he ſhewed them, that Galba was for his owne part a good harmeleſse olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but miſſe-led by two perſons much of Tigellinus making, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>inius and Laco: and therefore it vvere not amiſſe to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18156:11"/> ſende one or two in the name of the whole to make him remonſtrance, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing awaie thoſe two from about him hee ſhould bee more welcome, and better accepted. This ſpeech ſeeming ſtrange and abſurde to preſcribe to a Prince of thoſe yeares, as it were to an infant, his counſaile &amp; ſeruantes, he taketh a contrarie courſe, and writeth to Galba in terrifying maner, That the matters at Rome were doubtfull and dangerous, that Macer in Africke had ſtaied the ſhippes, the Legions of Germanie ſtirred a new, the like was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Iewrie and Syria. But perceiuing that Galba gaue to his tales ſmall eare and leſſe credit, and hauing the ſouldiers all well affected, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to preuent and giue the attempt, notwithſtanding that Clodius Celſus a ſober wiſe man and one of his frendes plainelie proteſted, that in his opinion ſcarce anie three perſons in Rome would accept him for Emperour: but the reſt skoffed it out, namelie one Mithridates of Pontus, Perhaps, quoth hee, Galba ſeemes ſome bodie now to the Romans, whileſt he is abſent: but when they ſhall ſee that balde head, and riueled face, hee vvill ſeeme the verie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and diſgrace of the daies in vvhich hee vvas Prince. And ſo they concluded at midnight following to bring Nymphidius into the campe and proclaime him Emperour. But vvhen the euening vvas come Antonius Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus a principall Tribune aſsembling the ſouldiers vnder his charge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vvhat euill ſpirit had bereaued them of vnderſtanding, moouing them ſo ſodainlie and vvithout cauſe to change their allegeance. If Nero de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it, vvhat mother, vvhat vvife, had Galba then killed? or for what miſdemeanour would they forſake Seruius Galba to preferre a curtizans ſonne? with whoſe bloud they ſhouldere it were long if they would bee dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by him, both reuenge Neroes death, whom hee firſt betraied, and ſhewe themſelues loyall to Galba againſt whom he intendeth: willing them lastlie to recken in reaſon what ſucceſſe might ten thouſand attende againſt the conſent of the Empire armed for Galba. His ſouldiers thus being perſuaded, perſuaded the reſt all in a maner to remaine in Galbaes obedience. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a ſhowte being made in the campe, Nymphidius ſuppoſing the ſouldiers had called him, or hasting to confirme the wauering, and preuent the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, went thither himſelfe with torches and linckes, hauing learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke an oration compoſed by Cingonius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arro, to pronounce there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. But finding the gates of the campe made fast, and ſouldiers in armes on the walles, he ſeared the matter, and drawing neare demanded what they ment, and by whoſe warrant they had put themſelues ſo in armes. and vvhen it vvas anſwered by all agreeablie, that they knew not, nor would not accept other Prince beſide Galba, Nymphidius finding the perill ioyned vvith them and vviſhed alſo long life and proſperitie to Galba
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18156:12"/> Auguſtus, commanding his followers to doe all the like. And ſo by the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which garded the gates, being admitted with a fewe of his traine, he was at his entrie vvelcomed in with a dart hurled at him, which one Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius bare of vvith a buckler. But ſeeing ſo manie at the receit vvith naked ſwordes prepared againſt him, hee fled, &amp; being purſued was ſlaine at the length in a ſouldiers cabin. The daie following his bodie was layed out to view in an open place rayled about.</p>
            <p>Galba being yet in his waie &amp; hearing of Nymphidius death comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reſt of his fauourers and complices to be executed: among which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates of Pontus paied for his mirth, and Cingonius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arro vvho penned the oration. As Galba drew neare to the Cittie at the Miluian bridge the Mariners met him, vvhom, being by Nero taken from ſeruice by ſea, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled into a Legion, Galba had comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to returne to their former eſtate. But they being many in number, &amp; loth to goe backe to the galleyes againe, beſet the hye waie on both ſides, demanding their Eagle &amp; enſeignes tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouslie, and ſo without order, that the Prince could neither bee heard nor ſeene of the people making his entrie: neither could he appeaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by putting them ouer to another time of greater leiſure and better audience, but taking differring as a kinde of denying, ſeditiouſly they murmured &amp; followed with outcries. And ſome of them alſo drew out their ſwords, as though they would obteine it by force, which by faire meanes they could not. Whereupon Galba commanding the horſemen to ride in amongſt them ſlew of them being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed ſeuen thouſand, and of the reſidue alotted euery tenth man to ſuffer, putting the reſt cloſe vp in priſon, which neuertheſſe hee after enlarged to his diſaduantage.</p>
            <p>Now Galba, being vvith generall applauſe and great good liking of the Empire placed in ſtate, behaued himſelfe vnder expectation. And though in moſt points he ſhewed himſelfe a vertuous Prince, yet vvere not his vvell doings ſo vvell accepted, as thoſe diſallowed vvhich vvere otherwiſe. All perſons vniuſtlie exiled by Nero, as well of the nobilitie as meaner ſort, vvith their children he mercifullie restored againe to their cuntrey and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though not to their vvealth. Contrarilie Petronius Turpilianus, an ancient man and once Conſull, vvithout forme of proceſſe or order of law, he commanded to die, being charged vvith no other crime, but onelie that hee had bene faithfull to Nero and vvould not betraie him as the rest did. Then vvas repreſented a plauſible and gratefull ſpectacle, Elius, Polycletus, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custa, Patrobius, Petinus and others in fetters drawen thorow the Cittie and publicklie executed, as miniſters of Nero in miſchieffes, vvhereas Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellinns the Master, not without notable incongruitie, was by Galba pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18156:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> And notwithſtanding the people in Theatres and all common aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ceaſt not importunately to demande his death, as an accompliſhment of due and exemplarie iustice pleaſing to God and to man, yet golde with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Vinius vvith Galba vveighed ſo much, that not onelie he receiued vndeſerued protection, but alſo for his ſake the people vvere rebuked by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke edict. VVhereupon Tigellinus ſolemnizing the feaſt of his deliuerance Vinius roſe from ſupper vvith Galba and vvent thither vvith Criſpina his daughter to banquet, vpon vvhom Tigellinus beſtowed a curteſie of<note n="*" place="margin">That is, about eight thouſand pound Engliſh.</note> a thouſand thouſand ſeſterces in readie money, and beſide all the iewels and Carcanets of his principall minion vvhich ſate there at table, by eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="margin">Almoſt fiue thouſand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> ſix hundreth thouſand ſeſterces. Beſide Tigellinus one Halotus of all Neroes instruments the moſt pernicious, vvas likewiſe by Galba protected, and preferred alſo to an honourable office. Now for neareneſſe Galba was noted extremelie, a vice though incident to age, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse in a Prince much miſliked, and in a new Prince dangerous. To a certaine muſician which had wonderfullie pleaſed he gaue with his owne handes out of his owne purſe<note n="*" place="margin">Three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Engliſh.</note> twentie ſeſterces: and to his steward at the making vp of his bookes a reward from his table. But that which was moſt materiall of all, and prepared the way to his fall, was his hardneſſe towardes the ſoldiers: to whom large donatiue being promiſed in Galbaes name, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quiring if not ſo much, yet ſo much at leaſt as they were wont to receiue, he wholly refuſed the ſuite, adding withal, That ſoldiers he tooke vp in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, bought not in the market. A ſaying no doubt fit for a great Prince in a more vetuous age, but not ſo in thoſe ſeaſons for him, who ſuffered himſelfe to be ſolde euerie howre, and abuſed to al purpoſes; to be gouerned by three peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>inius &amp; Laco his fauourites, &amp; Jcelus his man. To priuate men it is ſufficient if themſelues do no wrong: a Prince muſt prouide that none doe it about him; or els he may looke when the firſt occaſion is offred againſt him to be charged with all the whole reckening togither. To him that ſuffereth the iniurie, it matters not much who made the motion when he feeleth the hand that is heauy vpon him. Thus Galba though innocent of much harme which paſſed vnder his name, yet becauſe he permitted them to commit it, whom he ought to haue brideled, or was ignorant of that which he ought to haue knowen, loſt reputation, and opened the way to his owne deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>SOME few daies after the beginning of Ianuary, letters came out of Belgica from Pompeius Propinquus Procurator there, that the legions of vpper Germany without reſpect of oth and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty demanded another Emperour; and that this their reuolt might be the leſſe hainouſly taken, had referred the choiſe thereof to the Senate, and people of Rome. Theſe news haſtned the purpoſe of Galba, who had already a good while before deuiſed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and with ſome near about him, concerning the adoption. No ſpeech was for the time more common and curraunt in the whole city, partly vpon a licence and luſt to talke of ſuch matters, and partly becauſe Galba was ſpent and feeble for age: vpon iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or loue to the commonwealth very few, the moſt part vpon ſecret hopes, as they fauored or followed this man or that, offred occaſion to bring them in ſpeech for the ſucceſsion. And now Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius was grown into great hatred; who, as hee waxed daily more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18156:17"/> mighty, ſo daily more odious: for Galba with his too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie encreaſed and nouriſhed the greedy and gaping deſires of his friendes neuer ſatisfied in ſo greate meanes, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as vnder a Prince weake of body, and light of beleefe, with leſſe feare, and greater aduantage. The whole power of the Prince was diuided betweene Titus Vinius the Conſul, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Laco captaine of the garde. Neither was Icelus the freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inferiour in fauour with his maſter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> who being priuiledged to weare gold rings, &amp; made a gentleman, was commonly called by the name of Martianus. Theſe three, otherwiſe diſagreeing, and in points of leſſe importance drawing euery one a ſundry waie, in this conſultation of chuſing a ſucceſſour were diuided into two ſides. Vinius was for Marcus Otho: Laco and Icelus agreed not ſo much vpon any one, as vpon any other.

If this vaſt body of the Empire could ſtande without gouernour, balanced in due proportion and order, the free common wealth might worthilie haue taken beginning from me: but now it is come long agoe to that paſſe, that neither mine age can benefit the people of Rome any way more, then in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a good ſucceſſor, nor your youth, then in yeelding them a good Prince.

In the mean ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Galba was diſtracted with two diuers opinions.

The reſt were all of a contrary mind: that it was the much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, to cut of delaies with al poſſible ſpeed, before the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of few, as yet with out force, took furder encreaſe: that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Otho himſelfe would tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble for feare, who being conueied priuily away, &amp; brought in amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thoſe which knew not the matter, through ſloth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful delaying, &amp; trifling the time, learns now at his leaſure to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter fait the Prince. what? would they expect til Otho hauing compoſed the campe, &amp; ſet al in order, ſhould inuade the Place of publicke aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſembly, &amp; as Galba peeped but of a hole, vnder his noſe enter the Capitol; whileſt he, like a goodly trim captain, with his couragious friends, ſo they may be in couert, kept cloſe within dores, &amp; ſhut vp the gates, meaning belike to attende the ſiege there? much helpe might one hope for at bondmens handes, if the agreement of ſo greate a multitude, and their firſt indignation, which is alwaies the hoateſt, were ſuffered to coole. that therefore the partie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonorable was alſo more dangerous: or if needes they muſt die,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18156:22"/> then better to meete and encounter the danger: that woulde at leaſt breede Otho more enuy, and were withall moſt for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. As Vinius replied againſt the opinion, Laco, at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Icelus, perſiſting in priuate diſpleaſures to the ouerthrowe of the publicke eſtate, beginneth to charge him with manacing and threats: and Galba without any longer delay gaue himſelfe wholly to followe their counſell, which had the fairer ſhewe in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence. yet firſt was Piſo ſent to the campe, as beeing a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great name and gracious, freſh in mens fauour, and enemy to Vinius, either becauſe he was ſo, or that Vinius ilwillers did wiſh it to be ſo; and it is thought rather he was ſo indeede. Piſo was ſcant gone abroade, when firſl a flying rumour without autor was ſpred, that Otho was ſlaine in the campe: anone, as in great lies it falles out, ſome affirmed they were preſent, and ſaw it; a report which men partly reioycing, &amp; partly not curious,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> eaſily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Many ſuppoſed this rumour was framed, and increaſed by ſome of Othoes men, being now ſhuffled in with the reſt, &amp; giuing out vntruly good news of purpoſe to allure Galba out of his hold.

But the one being Lieutenant of Iewry, the other of Syria, countreyes confining, through emulation and enuy certaine ieloſies were betweene them: notwithſtanding vpon Neroes deceaſe, they layed grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges aſide, and conferred counſels in common, firſt by friendes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed,

Before Titus comming both the armies had ſworne allegeance to Otho, the newes of his beeing in ſtate, as the cuſtome is in ſuch greate matters, beeing brought in great poſt, and ciuill warres ripening by leaſure, into which the Eaſt, that had a long time bene quiet and peaceable, then firſt of all beganne for to enter, for in time paſt the moſt mightie and puiſſant ciuil warres, beginning in Italie and Gallia, were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with the power and ſtrength of the Weſt; and they which maintained them in the Eaſt, as Pompey, Caſſius, Brutus, Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ended alwaies vnfortunately, and Syria and Iewrie more often heard tel of then ſaw any Caeſars: the Legions had neuer mutined, onely ſometimes were led out to braue the Parthian, ſpeeding not alwaies alike: and during the laſt ciuil warre, when the worlde was ſhaken elſwhere, among them was aſſured tranquillitie; then faith toward Galba. But after it was publikely knowen, that Otho and Vitellius went about with impious armes to pray vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Roman eſtate, the ſoldiers began to ſtorme, that others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> receaued the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of Princes, &amp; they ſerued continually as ſlaues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from thence they grewe to conſideration of their owne forces: ſeuen Legions they ſawe at hand, and two prouinces, Syria &amp; Iewry, with a huge multitude of Ayde-ſoldiers: then AEgypt adioyning with two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, &amp; on the other ſide Cappadocia &amp; Pontus, &amp; the ſtrength which lay encamped againſt the Armenians: Aſia and the reſt of the prouinces, plentiful of money, and of men not vnfurniſhed: all the ilands of that ſea, and the ſea it ſelfe<note n="a" place="margin">Or lying out of the way from <hi>Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Othoes</hi> ſtrength. <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſum.</hi>

The forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſoldiers was not vnknowen to the Generals: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it was thought expedient to attende the iſſue of the other warre then being on foote, ſith doubtleſſe mutual ielouſies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the conquering and conquered party, would neuer ſuffer any ſound and perfect intelligence betweene them: neither mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it much whom fortune ſhould fauour, Vitellius or Otho: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſingular commanders by proſperity would growe inſolent,

So till occaſion ſhould ſerue, the open taking of armes was differred by Veſpaſian and Mucianus, hauing entred but lately into theſe communications, whereas the reſt had conferred thereof long before; the better ſorte vpon loue to the common wealth, the reſt, ſome allured with the ſweetnes of ſpoile, ſome pricked thereto by reaſon of their doubtful and decayed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate at home: ſo the good and the bad, vpon cauſes vnlike, with like affection ardently all deſired the warre.</p>

                  <p>THE reputation of Othoes victorious fleete eaſily held Corſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Sardinia, and the reſt of the ilandes thereabout in Othoes obedience.

For vpon hatred againſt Otho, he determined with the ſtrength of the ilande, to aide Vitellius; an aide vaine and to no purpoſe euen if it had ſucceeded. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> calling the principal men of the ilande, hee declareth his meaning, and commaundeth Claudius Phirrhicus maſter of the galleyes there, and Quinctius Certus a gentleman of Rome, to bee ſlaine, who oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt his proceedings: by the death of whome the reſt that were preſent beeing terrefied ſware allegeaunce to Vitellius, and conſequently the inferiour ſorte partly vppon ignoraunce, and partly to beare them company which did it for feare. But whenas Pacarius began to take muſter, to tire thoſe rude people in training and other militare duties, they waxing weary of that vnwonted labour fell to recount their own weakeneſſe: that it was but an ilande, which they inhabited: that Germanie and the Legionary power was far of: and that euen they were waſted and ſpoiled by the fleete, whom both cohorts and winges did protect. whereupon their minds ſodainly fel away, and ſo they conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, not by way of open rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by priuy atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt againſt his perſon. for which purpoſe chuſing out a fit opportunity, as hee was in the bath naked &amp; without helpe, the multitude that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him being departed away, they ſlew him and his company, and caried the heads of them, as of traitours, to Otho: by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

                  <p>IN the meane ſeaſon vnder the conduct of Paullinus and Celſus a notable ouerthrow was giuen. Caecinaes attempts all falling to nothing, and the reputation of his army now waning, much greeued his minde: he had bene repulſed from Placentia; his Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries lately ſlaine; and when as the diſcouerers met one another, in thoſe ordinary bickerings rather then materiall he commonly went to the worſe: whereupon when Fabius Valens approched, leſt the whole honor of the warre ſhould fall vpon him, he haſted with greater ſpeede then good counſell, to recouer his glory. About <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> twelue miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cremona, at a place called Caſtores, he placeth ſecretly in the woods, ioyning vpon the hye way, of his beſt Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ſoldiers, commanding the horſemen to goe out further, &amp; ſo hauing begun the skirmiſh to giue backe &amp; retire, drawing on the enemy to follow in the heate of the chace, vntil the ambuſh ſhould riſe: that purpoſe was bewraied to Othoes commaunders. Paulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus was General of the foote, &amp; Celſus of the horſe. The Vexilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the thirteenth Legion, fower Auxiliary cohorts, &amp; fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth horſe were placed in the left battell; in the middle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> three Praetorian cohorts, rancked ſtraitly together, kept their ſtanding vpon the hye way: in the right battel the firſt Legion marched, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two Vexillary cohorts, &amp; fiue hundreth horſe: &amp; out of the Praetorian &amp; Auxiliaries were led a thouſand horſe, for an ouer meaſure if fortune hapned to go on their ſide, or otherwiſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18156:44"/> a ſupply, if they ſhould be diſtreſſed. Before the ioining the Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſts turned their backs, &amp; Celſus, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the fraud, repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his men. The ambuſh riſing vp raſhly, as Celſus gaue grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſo far til they were circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uented themſelues: for on the ſides were the cohorts, &amp; the Legion to meete them in face, &amp; the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſodainly ranging out had encloſed their backes. Suetonius Paullinus at the firſt delaied ſome time to giue to his foote-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſigne of the battaile: for being a perſon naturally ſlow, &amp; one who liked much better wary courſes with reaſon, then happy by chace, he commanded the ditches firſt to be filled, the fielde to be made open and eaſy of paſſage, the battalions to be diſplaied, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſeaſonable enough to begin then to ouercome others, when as order was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they could not be ouercome themſelues. By meanes of that delay ſpace was giuen to Vitellius men to flee into the vines, where, by reaſon of the branches wrapped and knit one in another, it was troubleſome to follow: and a little wood adioyned which couered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; out of which they iſſued eftſones &amp; ſlew the formoſt of the Praetorian horſemen. there<note n="a" place="margin">King of what countrey? and how came he thither? and what became of him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? great perſons in a ſtory require, in my opinion, a more exact and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> king Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fighting valiantly on Othoes ſide, was wounded. By that time Othoes footmen preſſed forward, and bare downe by maine force the enemies hoſt, turning to flight euen thoſe alſo which came for to ſuccour. for Caecina ſent not for his cohortes together, but one after another: which thing in the fight augmented the terrour: for the feare of them that fled carried away the ſuccours, which came diſperſedly, and neuer ſo many at once, as to reſtore the battell. In the campe alſo a mutinee aroſe, becauſe they were fetched ſo ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly, and Iulius Gratus the Camp-maſter was put in priſon, as though in fauour of his brother, who ſerued vnder Otho, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome treaſon; whereas the Othonians had, on the other ſide, committed to ward Iulius Fronto his brother, a Tribune, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on colour of the ſame crime. But in trueth euery where the feare was ſo great, in thoſe which fled, in thoſe which met them, in the field and at the campe, that vnleſſe Suetonius Paullinus had ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the retrayt, not ſuffering his men to follow the victory, it was commonly talked on both ſides, that Caecina might haue beene deſtroied with his whole army.

                  <p>THIS ouerthrowe did not ſo much daunt the Vitellianiſts, as it reduced them to a more modeſt behauiour, not onely in Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinaes campe, who caſt the fault on the ſouldier more ready to mutin then fight; but the army of Fabius Valens alſo (for now he was come to Ticinum) laying aſide contempt of the enemy, and deſirous to recouer their glory, began to ſhew to their Generall a more reuerent and orderly obedience. For before a great and hoate mutinee had happened out, which I will now ſet downe from the beginning, albeit not in his proper time, becauſe it was not conuenient to interrupt the courſe of Caecinaes actions. The cohortes of Batauians, which in the warre of Nero were departed from the fourteenth Legion, and in their returne towarde Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, hearing of Vitellius attempt in the countrey of Lingones, had ioyned themſelues,<note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Hiſt. p.</hi> 43. and 45.</note> as before we haue ſhewed, to Fabius Valens, began to waxe proud and inſolent, vanting and brauing as they came to the tentes of any of the Legions, that they were the men which had ouerruled the fourteenth Legion, bereaued Nero of Italy: that in their handes alone lay all the fortune and whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this warre. That ſeemed contumelious to the ſouldier, and highly diſpleaſed the Generall, the diſcipline being by their wranglings and brawlings corrupted. At the laſt Valens, by their inſolent behauiour ſuſpecting perfidiouſneſſe alſo, receiuing aduiſe, that the wing of the Treueri and Tungrians were beaten by Othoes fleete, and that the prouince of Narbon was in ſome danger of inuaſion, partly vpon a care to defend his friendes and allies, and partly vpon militare pollicy to diſperſe theſe Bataui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſo mutinouſly affected, and of ſo great ſtrength if they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, commaunded part of the cohorts to goe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them. Which thing when it was heard and noyſed abroad, the Auxiliaries mourned, the<note n="b" place="margin">It ſeemeth ſtrange, that the Legions ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the departure of thoſe, whoſe inſolent and contumelious behauiour they could not abide, if <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſay true not paſt ſix lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> Legions ſtomacked, lamenting they ſhould be depriued in ſuch a time of ſo maine an aſsiſtaunce of ſuch valiant men: what? ſhould thoſe ſo experienced, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours

Then Alphenus Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus the Campe-maſter, perceauing the heate of the mutinee paſt, and the ſouldiers by little and little to growe colder, adioyneth a pollicie thereunto:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> forbidding the Centurions to meddle with ſearching and peruſing the watch, and omitting to ſound the trumpet, by which the ſouldier is called to his charge. Whereupon they ſtoode all amazed, looking one on another, aſtoniſhed and diſmayed to ſee themſelues thus without head, or direction: and ſo with ſilence and patience, and laſtly with teares and intreatie beſought pardon of their offence. But whenas Valens came foorth aboue all expectation aliue, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and badly attired, then was there ioy and compaſsion, and a generall fauouring of the man: and chaunging their former affections into gladneſſe, as the common ſort is in both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, they caried him in the middeſt of the Standerds and enſeignes, with praiſes and gratulations, to the Tribunall. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, vſing a profitable and diſcreete moderation, required not any one to bee executed for this tranſgreſsion; onely in wordes reproued ſome fewe, leſt if he diſſembled the whole, he ſhould be ſuſpected the more: knowing right well that in ciuill warres the ſouldiers haue a vantage ouer the Generall, and are more bolde to commit diſorders, then the Generall may be to correct them. As they were entrenching at Ticinum, woorde was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18156:45"/> brought of Caecinaes ouerthrowe, and the ſedition was almoſt renewed againe, as though by fraud and delayes of Valens they had bene kept backe, and come ſhort of the battell. Whereupon refuſing to reſt any longer, without ſtaying for their Generall they marche forwarde, running before their enſeignes, and haſtening the enſeigne-bearers: and ſo in all ſpeede ioyne with Caecina. Valens was alſo diſliked and generally blamed in the armie of Caecina: who pretended themſelues to bee ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeued, that they were left, being ſo farre inferiour in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as a pray to the whole power of the enemies; highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling withall the ſtrength of the other army, partly to excuſe themſelues, and partly to flatter their fellowes, leſt as conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and cowardly perſons they ſhoulde bee deſpiſed of them: and albeit Valens had more forces, almoſt double number of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Aides to the other, yet were the goodwilles of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers more inclining to Caecina, beſide curteſie, wherein he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the other, by reaſon alſo of his floriſhing age, and talneſſe of ſtature, and vppon a certaine vaine fauour of men. Hereupon there grew emulation betweene the two generalles. Caecina con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the other, as a lewde perſon of life and criminally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Valens ſcoffed at him as being proude and vaineglorious: but reſeruing their hatred in ſecrete they ioyned openly both in the common cauſe, by many letters, without reſpect of pardon, obiecting to Otho his infamous life; whereas the Generalles of Othoes ſide, notwithſtanding the argument yeelded that way moſt plentifull matter, abſtained from all reuiling ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Vitellius: and in trueth before their endes, which on O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoes ſide was moſt commendable, of Vitellius moſt ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the drowſy pleaſures of Vitellius were feared leſſe, then the hoat burning luſtes of Otho: and beſide, the death of Galba had made Otho more terrible, and more odious: contrarily no man charged Vitellius with beginning the warre. Vitellius in exceſſe &amp; bellicheere was an enemy to himſelfe: Otho in riot, cruelty, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſneſſe, reputed more dangerous to the ſtate.</p>

Nowe the Germans, which of all the enemies were moſt terrible, hauing foggy and wateriſh bodies, would not, if the warre were prolonged to the ſommer, be able to endure the change of the ſoile, and the avre. that many armies whoſe fury at the firſt ruſh could not be reſiſted, by delayes &amp; wearying out were brought vnto nothing.

That within fewe daies the fourteenth Legion would bee come, a Legion of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18156:46"/> great reputation, with the forces of Moeſia: then might he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate againe, and, if it were liked to hazarde the battell, fight with more power and greater aduantage. Marius Celſus appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the opinion of Paullinus, and certaine which were ſent to Annius Gallus (who was hurte with a fall of his horſe a few daies before) to demaunde his aduiſe, brought woorde that hee alſo was of the ſame iudgement. But Otho was willing to bring it to a battell: his brother Titianus and Proculus captaine of the Gard, haſtening vpon ignoraunce and lacke of ſkill, proteſted, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and all the gods, with the godhead of Otho, fauoured the counſailes, and woulde without queſtion proſper the enterpriſe: deſcending to this groſſe kinde of flattery, leſt any ſhoulde dare to croſſe their opinion.

Vpon the end of the bridge a tower was planted, reaching to the vttermoſt boate, that out of it they might with their engines and ſhot diſplace, and driue away the enemies: the Othonians alſo vpon the bancke had builded a tower, and did hurle ſtones and fire. In the middle of the riuer there was an iland, into poſſesſion whereof the fencers ſought to put themſelues by boate, but the Germans by ſwimming preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; and when Macer ſaw a competent number of them arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued there, embarking of his beſt fencers, he putteth ouer to aſſaile them: but neither were the fencers of the like courage in fight to the ſouldiers, neither could they, tottering out of their boats, ayme ſo certaine a blow, as the other ſteadily ſtanding did from the lande: and whenas through ſundry ſteppings aſide vpon feare the rowers and ſouldiers, which ſtoode at defence, were confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled together and put in diſorder, the German ſouldiers leaping couragiouſly into the ſhallow, and hanging at the tailes of the boats, either clambered vp to the hatches, or by maine ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ouerturned the boats into the water.

For my part, although I could bee induced to grant that ſome fewe peraduenture ſecretely wiſhed quietneſſe in ſteede of diſcorde, and for two moſt lewde and wicked, one good and innocent Prince; ſo I cannot be brought to beleeue, that Paullinus beeing ſo wiſe a man woulde euer hope in a moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt age for ſuch moderation in the common ſorte, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as for deſire of warre they had troubled the peace of the ſtate, nowe for loue of peace they woulde abandon the warre: or that armies in tongue and conditions ſo different, coulde conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcende to ſo great an agreement: or that the Lieutenantes and Generals, which for the moſt part were perſons drowned in riot, beggerly and guilty of moſt hainous crimes, would euer haue ſuffered any Prince but one polluted with the like vices, and of their owne creation, and therefore wholly obnoxious to them. That ancient deſire of dominion and rule engraffed now long agoe in mens hartes, grewe vp and ſhotte out with the greatneſſe of the Empire. For whileſt our dominions were ſtrayt, an equality was eaſily maintained: but after wee had ſubdued the world, deſtroied all cities, or kings which ſtoode in our light, or might worke our annoiance; whenas we had leiſure to ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wealth voide of perill, there aroſe firſt hoat contentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the nobility and commons: ſometimes factious Tribunes caried it away: ſometimes the Conſuls held a hard hand &amp; preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:

                  <p>WHen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Otho was gone to Brixellum, Titianus his brother caried the countenance and title of General; Proculus cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Garde the power and authority: Paullinus and Celſus, whenas no man employed their wiſedome &amp; skill, were captaines only for nameſake and to be entitled to other mens faults: the Tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bunes and Centurions, ſeeing the better contemned, &amp; the worſt ſort in credit, were doubtfull of the euent: the ſouldier notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was full of courage and heart, yet ſuch as had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue then execute his Generals commaundementes. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, that the campe ſhould remoue forward, and ſit downe in a place fower miles of from Bebriacum, ſo without reaſon and skill, that although it was ſpring time of the yeare, and ſo many riuers about them, yet were they diſtreſſed for water. There it was diſputed whether the battell were to bee giuen or not. For Otho by letters required to haſten the matter: the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers deſired their Princes preſence in fielde: many were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18156:48"/> to ſende for the companies which lay on the other ſide of the Po. Neither can it ſo eaſily be diſcerned what had beene beſt to haue done, as that it was the worſt which they did: vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to goe to the confluence of the riuers of Po and Olium full ſixteene miles from that place (a competent iourney for an army to marche, and much too great for them which went to a battell) directly againſt the aduiſe of Paullinus and Celſus; who helde it vnſafe to hazard the ſouldier, tired with the iourney, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy laden with cariage, againſt an enemy, that woulde not faile, beeing lightly appointed, and hauing come ſcarce fower miles, to charge vppon them either as they marched in diſarray, or elſe at their ſitting downe as they diſperſed themſelues to fortifie the campe.

The ſame day as Caecina was buſily occupied about making the bridge, two Tribunes of Praetorian cohorts came thither, demanding to ſpeake with him: and being vpon the point to giue audience, &amp; make anſwere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the skowts came ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning in haſt, ſignifying the enemy was at hand: whereupon the parlee brake of, &amp; ſo it remained vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what they intended, whether to lay a trayne for Caecina, or to betray their owne fellowes, or els ſome other honeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. Caecina hauing diſmiſſed the Tribunes, riding backe to the campe, founde the ſigne of the battell already giuen by Valens commaundement, and the ſouldiers in armes. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Legions caſt lots concerning their order in marching to the field, the horſemen iſſuing out charged, &amp; were beaten backe very ſtrangely, by Othoes men being fewer in number, euen into the trenches, had not the Italian Legion manfully drawen their ſwords, and by feare forced them to returne and make head vpon the enemy againe. The Vitellian Legions were ordered and put in array without tumult or feare: for the buſhes and thickets tooke a way the ſight of the enemy, albeit he were neare. Contrarily in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoes army the Generals with feare were put out of their skill; the ſouldiers neither loued nor truſted their Generals; the wagons
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18156:49"/> and idle followers of the camp troubled the works of the ſoldiers, being confuſedly mingled amongſt them; &amp; the hye way deepely ditched on both ſides was too narrow for an army, though march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without feare of the enemy: ſome ſtoode about, ſome ſought their enſeignes, on euery ſide there was a confuſed noiſe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Their mindes being in this ſorte ſtriken with a ſodaine terrour, a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurmiſed ioy abated their fierceneſſe: for ſome there were which vntruly gaue out, that the army was reuolted from Vitellius. That rumour whether it was diſperſed abroade by Vitellius ſpyes, or roſe otherwiſe among Othoes men, whether by frawd or chance, it is not certainly knowen: but howſoeuer, thereupon the Othoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans laying aſide all edge to fight, in ſteede thereof profered after a friendly ſort to ſalute them, but were with vnfriendly murmure intertained againe: which ſalutation gaue cauſe to many of their owne ſide, that were ignorant of the rumour, to feare treaſon. Then the hoſt of the enemies in good array, ſuperiour both in number &amp; ſtrength, charged vpon them: the Othonians, although in diſarray, fewer and weary, yet valiantly receaued the charge. And as in places troubled with trees and vines the fight was not euery where after one maner: but here neare at hand, and there a farre of: ſometime in ſquadron, ſometime in triangle figure: vpon the height of the way ioining foote to foote, and bearing downe with body to body, and buckler to buckler: omitting the vſe of the dart, and with ſwordes and hatchets vnbuckeling and breaking helmets and corcelets: and the ſides knowing one another, and beeing ſeene of their companions, ech contended to ſhewe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and valure, as if vppon their manhood had depended the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of the whole warre. It fortuned, that in open field betweene the Po &amp; the high way, two Legions met and fought together; for Vitellius the one and twentieth ſurnamed Rapax, a Legion aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently renowned, of Othoes part the firſt called Adiutrix, one neuer before brought to the battel, but preſuming greatly of hir ſelfe, &amp; greedy, as in hir firſt ſervice, of honour.

For entring into the campe a<note n="c" place="margin">It is very queſtionable how in one day an army could goe 16. miles, ioyne battell, break, and fleeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way 20. miles of could come thither a great while before night about mid-Aprill.</note> great while before it was night, he was exclaimed vpon &amp; railed at on euery ſide, with clamors of the moſt ſeditious and cowardly perſons: who forbearing to vſe neither tongues nor hands, reuiled him as a fugitiue and traitour, not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſpecialty they could charge him withall, but after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the common ſort, ech man laying his owne ſhames vpon others. Titianus and Celſus returned not before night, which ſerued them to good purpoſe. for the watch was now ſet, and the ſoldiers fury appeaſed by the help of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Annius Gallus: who partly by intreaty and aduiſe, partly by his credit and authority, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them not to heape miſery vpon miſerie, and beſide the loſſe of the battell to ſeeke the ſpoile one of another: that whether the warre were now at an ende, or els it would pleaſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, the onely meanes to releeue the conquered ſide conſiſted in their agreeing together. And indeede the reſt were out of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and comfort: onely the Garde-ſouldiers ſtormed, affirming they were ouercome not by manhood but treaſon: and that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellian ſide had bought the victory dearly with their bloud, their horſemen being repulſed, &amp; the ſtanderd of a Legion taken away, that there yet remained in ſtore many ſouldiers beyond the Po at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on Otho: the Legions of Moeſia were comming at hand, &amp; that a great part of the army had ſtaied behinde at Bebriacum and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18156:50"/> neuer preſented themſelues to the battell: that ſurely theſe at the leſt had not beene ouercome: and if ſo needes it muſt bee, they ſhould with more honour dye in the fielde. Vpon theſe and the like cogitations ſometimes growing deſperate, and ſometimes yeelding to feare, through conſideration of their owne forlorne eſtate, they were incited more often to rage then to relent. The Vitellian army lodged fiue miles from Bebriacum, the Generalles not daring that day to attempt the enemies campe: and beſide a voluntary yeelding was hoped for: where albeit they coulde not entrench, as men that went out lightly appointed and onely to fight, yet their weapons in hande, and the victory they lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, was a ſufficient defence. The day following thoſe of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoes men which had made ſhew of moſt courage, repenting and yeelding, the whole army with one accorde ſent an Embaſſage to the Vitellianiſts. The Vitellian Generals without any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on graunted them peace: onely the Embaſſadours were ſtaied there for a ſeaſon, which bred a ſcruple in the minds of the other, not knowing whether they had obtayned as yet or not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: but anone the Embaſſage returning, the campe was ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Then both the conquered and conquerers, breaking out into weeping, with a wofull ioyfulneſſe, deteſted the miſery of ciuill diſſenſions: and meeting in the ſame tentes, ſome comforted their brethren, ſome their friendes which were wounded. Hopes and rewardes were doubtfull and in expectation alone: burials and mournings were certaine and ſure before hand: neither was there any ſo voide of miſchaunce, that had not to mourne for ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies death. The body of Orphidius the Lieutenant was ſought out, and buried with accuſtomed ſolemnity, &amp; ſome few beſide by their friends: the reſt of the common ſort were left on the ground.</p>

Then hee commaunded thoſe which departed to bee furniſhed of wagons and barges; burned all bookes and letters containing any matter notably in fauour of himſelfe or disfauour of Vitellius, and diſtributed money ſparingly, and not as one that ſhoulde dye.

What? were it poſsible, that Vitellius ſhould be ſo hard hearted, and cruelly minded, as not to doe him that one pleaſure, whereas he had preſerued for him his whole houſe without harme? that at leaſt by this haſty diſpatch of himſelfe he deſerued that ſome curteſie ſhould be ſhewed his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: eſpecially hauing forborne, for the loue of his countrey, to ſeeke his laſt and vttermoſt remedy; not vppon extreme deſpaire, but then, whenas his army with inſtance demanded to bring it to a battell againe. but, he ſaid, for his part he had gotten renowne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for himſelfe, and nobility for his poſterity, after the Iulian, Claudian, and Seruian families, hauing firſt of al men brought into a houſe of no great continuance the honor of hauing an Emperor: and therefore he willed him with good courage to liue and go on, neither forgetting at any time that Otho was his vnkle, nor yet too

After theſe things he willed all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and giue place, and gaue himſelfe a while to his reſt: but a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine tumult interrupted the courſe of his laſt cares, word being brought in of the diſordered &amp; outragious behauiour of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; who threatned to kill all thoſe which went away, but were moſt egerly bent againſt Verginius, whoſe houſe being ſhut they beſet round about. Whereupon Otho went out, &amp; hauing rebuked the principal mutins, returning againe ſpent the time in talking &amp; comforting them which departed, vntil they were al ſafely conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away. When it grew toward night, he quenched his thirſt with a cup of cold water, then two rapiers were brought in: and after hee had tried their points he put the one vnder his pillow: and hauing certaine knowledge that his friends were already gone, he paſſed the night in good reſt, and as it is ſaid not without ſleep: aſſoone as it was day he ranne himſelfe through the breſt with the rapier. vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his groning, as he was dying his freed and bondmen, with Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Firmus captaine of the Garde, entred in, and found but onely one wound.

                  <p>WHEN the warre was euerywhere at an ende, a great part of the Senate, which accompanied Otho from Rome, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſtaied by order at Mutina, incurred extreme danger. For when word was brought thither of the ouerthrow, the ſouldiers reiected the newes as falſe: and ſuppoſing the Senate to be enemy to Otho, they obſerued their ſpeeches, interpreting their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, and externall behauiour to the worſt; not abſtaining at the laſt from reuiling, and contumelious termes, and apparently ſeeking an occaſion to begin a maſſacre: whereas the Senatours had beſide to ſtande in feare another way, leſt they ſhould ſeeme not forward enough to like of Vitellius victory, with whome now all the world was gone. Thus trembling, and betweene both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubtfull how to cary themſelues, they meete together, none daring to followe any priuate direction, but aſſociating himſelfe with the multitude, preſuming thereby of greater ſecurity.

But by the moderation of the better ſort interpoſing themſelues the matter was pacified: &amp; ſo they went all backe to Bononia, there to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate anew, hoping withall in the meane ſeaſon to receiue more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements.

                  <p>IN the meane ſeaſon Vitellius, ignoraunt of his owne victorie, made preparation as for a warre new to begin, and caried with

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this place.</note> After the ſpeech, his army inſtantly requeſted him to create Aſiaticus his freedman a Gentleman of Rome: which ſhamefull flatterie he then rebuked; and ſoone after vpon a fickleneſſe of wit, that which he had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed, he priuily beſtowed in banquet, and honoured with rings Aſiaticus, a baſe abiect ſlaue, and one ſeeking to riſe by ill meanes. About the ſame time meſſage was brought that Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Procuratour of both Mauretanies was ſlaine, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes had ſided themſelues with Vitellius. Lucceius Albinus was by Nero ſet ouer Mauretania Caeſarienſis, and Galba annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the adminiſtration of Tingitana; ſo that he had forces of good moment vnder his charge: 18. cohorts, fiue wings, and an infinite number of Moores not vnfit for the warre, as men that vſually li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of ſtealing &amp; harrowing their neighbours. When Galba was ſlaine he followed the party of Otho, and not contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with Africke, had a purpoſe for Spaine, being diſioyned from it by a narrow ſtrayte. Hereupon Cluvius Rufus was afraide, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the tenth Legion to aproach to the ſhoare, as if he ment to haue ſhipped ouer: ſending before certaine Centurions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the mindes of the Moores to fauour Vitellius: neither was it harde to effect. For the fame of the German army was great throughout all the prouinces, and beſide a reporte was ſpredde, that Albinus contemning the name of a Procurator, had vſurped a royal diademe, &amp; the name of<note n="b" place="margin">The laſt king of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retania,</hi> ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Caeſar. anno vrb. cond.</hi> 708.</note> Iuba. So their mindes being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, thereupon they went and ſlewe Aſinius Pollio captaine of a wing, one of Albinus faithfulleſt friends, &amp; Feſtus and Scipio two captaines of cohorts: Albinus himſelfe as he went by ſea from Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitana to Mauretania Caeſarienſis was ſlaine as he landed, and his wife withal, who voluntarily offred hir ſelfe to the ſlaughter. Theſe thinges and all els that was done Vitellius paſſed ouer without due examination, as his maner was with a ſhort audience to turne

Nowe Vitellius vpon the comming of his brother, &amp; certaine ſchoolemaſters of tyranny creeping into the court, waxing prowder &amp; fiercer, commanded Dolabella, whom, as before we remembred, Otho had confined to Aquinum, vpon this occaſion to be ſlaine. Dolabella, hearing that Otho was dead, was returned to Rome: whereof Plautius Varus once Praetor, one of Dolabellaes moſt inward friendes, accuſed him before Flauius Sabinus the Prouoſt of the city, as if he had broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priſon, to the end to make offer of himſelfe for a head to the conquered faction: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moreouer, that to that purpoſe he had felt the cohort, which was in garriſon at Oſtia: but hauing no one proofe of any of theſe ſo great crimes, he began to repent of his wicked deede, &amp; ſought pardon, but too late, after the facte. As Flauius Sabinus was in doubt how to proceede, in a matter of that wayght, Triaria the wife of Lucius Vitellius, fierce and cruell aboue the ordinary of that ſexe, terrified him; warning him not to affect the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of clemency by the perill of his Prince. Sabinus a man of his owne nature of a milde diſpoſition, but when hee was put in a feare eaſie to be changed, and fearing to make another mans danger his owne, leſt he ſhoulde ſeeme to haue helped him vp, as hee was falling puſhed him forwarde. So Vitellius, partly vppon feare, and partly vpon an olde grudge, becauſe Dolabella had taken Petronia to wife ſtraight vpon hir deuorce from him, called him by letters to him: and commanding to auoide the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Flaminian way, and carry him by Interamna, he gaue commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to murther him there. that ſeemed too long to him who had the commisſion: &amp; therefore in an inne by the way, as Dolabella reſted himſelfe on the grounde, he cut his throat, to the great infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the new gouernment, wherof this was the firſt proofe. This kinde of behauiour of Triaria was the more odious, by ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it the modeſty of hir next neighbour Galeria the Emperors wife, heaping not ſorrowes vpon the ſorrowfull, and the rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Sextilia his mother, a woman of the ancient ſort: who is alſo reported to haue ſaied at the reading of hir ſonnes firſt letters, that a Vitellius was borne by hir &amp; not a Germanicus: neither did ſhee afterwardes through any allurements of fortune, or courting of the city, participate any thing els of hir ſonnes eſtate, ſaue onely the ſmarts of hir houſe when it fell.</p>

Hilarius the Emperours freedman had articled againſt him, that hearing of Vitellius and Othoes contention for the Empire, he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to erect a ſouerainty of his owne, and aſſure to himſelfe the poſſeſsion of Spaine: and therefore had named in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his<note n="*" place="margin">

But the credit of Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius preuailed ſo farre, that Vitellius contrarily commaunded his man to be puniſhed, and aſſumed Cluvius into his traine; ſuffering him withall to enioy Spaine, which he gouerned ſtill notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his abſence, according to the precedent of<note n="a" place="margin">Tac. <hi>4.</hi> Ann. p, <hi>387.</hi>
                     </note> Lucius Arrun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, whom Tiberius Caeſar retained for feare, but Vitellius kept Cluvius vpon no ſuch ielouſie. Trebellius Maximus had not the like fauour: he fled out of Britannie, becauſe the ſouldiers were incenſed againſt him; and Vectius Bolanus was ſent in his place.</p>
                  <p>Of all matters preſent that vexed Vitellius moſt, to ſee the vanquiſhed Legions retaine their ſtomackes vnuanquiſht: being diſperſed thorow Italie together with the winners, in all ſpeeches they ſhewed themſelues affected as enemies, and namely the fourteenth Legion; who caried the greateſt ſtomacke of them all, denying that euer they were ouercome: that in the battell at Bebriacum the Vexillaries onely were put to flight, the ſtrength of the Legion being not preſent. Wherefore it was thought expedient to ſende them backe into Britannie, from whence they were called by Nero; and in the meane time, that they and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts of Batauians ſhould quarter together, by reaſon of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient iarring between them. Neither could they, hauing both wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in hande and hating ech other ſo deadly, agree long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At Turin as one of the Batauians quarreled with an artificer, as hauing coozened him, and a Legionary ſoldier tooke his part, and defended him as beeing his hoſt, their companions ſorting themſelues ech to their felow, from bitter words paſſed to blowes:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18156:55"/> and a bloudy battaile had beene fought, had not two Praetorian cohorts taken the Legionaries part, and ſo much increaſed their ſtrength, that the Batauians were forced for feare to giue ouer. Vpon which accident Vitellius commanded to vnite to his traine the Batauians, as wellwillers to the cauſe, and to ſend the Legion away and conduct it ouer the Graian Alpes, by the way that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vienna; for they of Vienna alſo were had in a ielouſie. That night the Legion remoued, fires being left here and there negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently vnput out, part of Turin was burnt: which dammage, as many other bad effectes of that warre, greater calamities of other cities did vtterly blot and put out of remembrance. The Legion hauing paſſed the Alpes, ſome of the moſt ſeditious among them caried their enſeignes toward Vienna: but by the conſent of the better ſort they were ſtaied; and ſo the Legion was tranſported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Britanny.

The remedy of this tumult was another tumult. duſt and gliſtering of armour was ſeene a farre off: and ſodainely it was noiſed in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that the fourteenth Legion was returned with intention to fight: but it was their own riereward; which being perceiued, that care was ended. In the meane ſeaſon, as one of Verginius ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants by chaunce came by, the ſouldiers charge and accuſe him, that he was ſet to kil Vitellius, &amp; ruſh thereupon into the banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting place requiring the death of Verginius. No man doubted of Verginius innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, no not Vitellius himſelfe, although otherwiſe very ſuſpicious and fearefull: and notwithſtanding they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the death of ſo honourable a perſonage, and one which had once beene their Generall, yet were they hardly appeaſed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any man ſo oft ſhot at as Verginius in all ſeditions and mutinous aſſemblies: the admiration and fame of the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained amongſt them; but they hated him deadly, becauſe he had contemned their offer.

Now to the end that the treaſure and reuenues of the Empire, though miniſhed and waſted, might ſuffice for his exceſsiue and prodigall donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he commandeth to leſſen the number of ſouldiers in the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Aydes, forbidding ſupplies to be made, and offering diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions indifferently: which action of his proued pernicious to the ſtate, and vnpleaſant to the ſouldiers.

                  <p>IT is ſcarcely credible, how greatly Vitellius grewe in pride and ſlothfulneſſe, whenas the ſoldiers ſent for that purpoſe brought worde out of Syria and Iewry, that the Eaſt had ſworne allegeance vnto him. For Veſpaſian, albeit only vpon a flying report without any certaine autor, was in euery mans mouth, and commonly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and oftentimes as hee was named Vitellius would ſtartle. Then he &amp; his army, as being without any concurrent in cruelty, in luſt, in oppreſsion, brake out into barbarous and forraine beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. But Veſpaſian in the meane ſeaſon laying his plot for the warre, entred into conſideration of the forces both neare and far of. His owne ſoldiers were ſo ready in his behalfe, that when he beganne them the othe and wiſhed all proſperity to Vitellius, the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18156:57"/> ſoldiers anſwered with ſilence, without either good wiſh or good worde. Mutianus was not aliene from Veſpaſian, and toward Titus very well affected. Alexander the gouernour of Aegypt had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the confederacy. The third Legion, becauſe it was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred out of Syria into Moeſia, Veſpaſian reckened as his owne: and the reſt of the Illyrian Legions it was hoped would folow. For the inſolent behauiour of the ſouldiers which came from Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius, with their proud geſtures and lookes, and rude ſpeeches, deſpiſing all others as baſe and inferiours, had wonderfully offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the armies beſide. But to enter into ſo weighty a warre was a point not ſo quickly reſolued vpon: and Veſpaſian albeit he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the beſt, forecaſt ſometimes the worſt in his minde: what a day would that be for him, in the which he ſhould commit to the mercy of the warre himſelfe of threeſcore yeares of age, and his two ſonnes in the flower of their youth? that in priuate attempts a man might proceede &amp; ſtop where he liſted; but to them which deſired the Empire there was no midle courſe, betweene the eſtate of a Prince and the death of a traitour.

Moreouer that in ciuill diſſenſions the faith of the ſoldier was fleeting: and that there was perill to be feared from euery particular man. For what would co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts and wings auaile, if one or two, to attaine the rewarde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the otherſide, would deſperately venture to kill him? ſo Scribonianus was ſlaine vnder Claudius, and ſo his murderer Volaginius of a common ſoldier was preferred to the higheſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſeruice. that it was a more eaſie matter to incite all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beware of eueryone in particular. As he ſemed to wauer moued with theſe feares, both the other Lieutenants with the reſt of his friendes ſought to confirme him, and Mutianus after many and ſecret conferences, now alſo in open councell ſpake to him in this wiſe. <q rend="margQuotes">"All men, which are to enter into great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant actions, ought to weigh with themſelues, whether that which is vndertaken be profitable to the common wealth, honourable for themſelues, and eaſie to be effected, or at leaſt not greatly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult: withall the party that perſwadeth vnto it is to be conſidered,

Next after the gods it is in your hande to attaine it: and feare not as though I ſayde it to flatter: it is more neare a diſgrace then a prayſe to be choſen after Vitellius.

Haue you forgotten how Corbulo was murdred? a man of greater lignage then we are, I grant: &amp; ſo was Nero likewiſe then Vitellius. He that is feared is alwaies noble enough in his conceit that doth feare: and that a Prince may be made by the ſouldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, Vitellius himſelfe hath ſhewed the way; a man otherwiſe which neuer ſerued in field, neuer attained to any militare renown but preferred onely vpon a diſlike of Galba, and now ſo diſliked himſelfe, that Otho, whom hee ouercame, not by ſtrategeme or ſtrength, but by his own haſty caſting away of himſelfe, is become a notable Prince &amp; much wiſhed for: wheras Vitellius in the mean time diſperſeth the Legions, diſarmeth the cohorts, and miniſtreth daily new matter of warre. His own ſouldier if he had any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or edge, it is dulled and worne away, in tipling and brothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes, and following the Princes example. You haue out of Iewry, Syria and Aegypt nine complete Legions in readineſſe, not waſted by warre, nor corrupted with mutinees; but a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier confirmed with practiſe and vſe, and hartened with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py exployts againſt forrayne enemies.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18156:60"/> the cauſe. Whereupon they feared diſpleaſure, and vpon feare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, that this kinde of dealing, which to Vitellius muſt haue nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a long and ſolemne excuſe, might to Veſpaſian be ſet vp and reckened as a fauour and benefit. So the three Moeſian Legions, thus concurring in one, by letters inuited the Pannonian armie to the cauſe, or if they refuſed, prepared to force them. In that tumult Aponius Saturninus Lieutenant general of Moeſia endeuoured to commit a moſt wicked act, ſending a Centurion to murder Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Iulianus Lieutenant of the ſeuenth Legion, vpon priuate grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, pretending the publicke cauſe of the ſides. Iulianus vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the danger, &amp; taking guides skilful in the countrey, fled by the deſerts of Moeſia, beyonde the mount Hemus, and afterward was not preſent in the ciuill warre of the one ſide or other: protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the iourney he tooke to Veſpaſian by diuerſe delaies, and as the occurrences were, making leſſe ſpeede or more. But in Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia the thirteenth Legion, and ſeuenth ſurnamed Galbiana, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the anger and griefe of the loſte at Bebriacum, without any ſtay ioined themſelues to Veſpaſian, at the incitement principally of Antonius Primus, a man attainted in law, &amp; in Neroes time<note n="c" place="margin">Tacitus <hi>14.</hi> Ann. p. <hi>497.</hi>
                     </note> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uicted of forgery, but among other miſeries of warre and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſtate he recouered his place in the Senate, and by Galba was made Lieutenant of the ſeuenth Legion. He was ſuppoſed to haue written diuerſe letters to Otho, offering his ſeruice for a captaine to the ſide; of whom being not regarded, he was not that warre in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny employment: but when as Vitellius ſtate beganne to decay, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Veſpaſian he added great waight to the cauſe, being a man valiant of his hands, of a ready vtterance, a cunning crafteſmaſter to make others odious, in diſſenſions &amp; mutinees powerable, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ſpoyler, a waſtful ſpender, in time of peace &amp; quiet gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inſupportable, in warre not to be contemned. The Moeſian and Pannonian armies, being thus ioyned together, drew anone the Dalmatian ſoldier, albeit the Lieutenaunts generall ſturred nothing at al. Titus Flauianus was general of Pannonia, and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius Sullanus of Dalmatia, two wealthy old men: but there was in the countrey Cornelius Fuſcus the Procurator, a man in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſtrength of his age, and of noble birth; who in his firſt yeares vpon deſire of eaſe, had renounced his place in Senate, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde being captaine of his colony in fauour of Galba, by that meanes attained a Procuratorſhip. This man, entring into the

So he aſſaieth to ſhake and ſturre vp whatſoeuer there was any where diſcontented, writing into Britanny to the fourteenth Legion, into Spaine to the firſt, becauſe they both had ſtoode againſt Vitellius for Otho: letters alſo were ſent abroad into France: and ſo in one moment there brake a great and mighty warre out, the Illyrian armies thus plainely reuolting, and the reſt inclining to followe, where fortune ſhould fauour.</p>

Neither were the colonies onely or free townes impoueriſhed by purueying of vittailes for ſo huge a company; but the husbandmen themſelues, &amp; fieldes, the corne being now ripe, were ſpoiled and waſted as an enemie countrey. Many and cruell murders were committed by the ſouldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, by reaſon of the iarring which continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Legions and Aydes, euer ſince the ſturre at Ticinum: againſt the pezantes, or any third party they agreed but too well:

Notwithſtanding in Rome the terrour was great, by reaſon of the ſouldiers running and gadding thither before.

Moreouer the citty-ſouldiery was through vndiſcreetneſſe or ambition corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Sixteene Praetorian cohorts and foure vrban were enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, containing a thouſand men a piece. In preferring to thoſe roomes Valens preſumed to beare greater ſtroake, as being the worthier man, and hauing redeemed Caecina himſelfe out of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill: and in trueth by his comming the ſide was reuiued, and with ſo happy a battell he cancelled the hard opinion of his ſlow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forward: and all the ſouldiers of lowe Germanie followed Valens and depended wholly vpon him: vpon which cauſes it is ſuppoſed that Caecinaes faith beganne firſt to be fleeting. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Vitellius yeelded not ſo much to the captaines, but that he yeelded much more to the ſouldiers pleaſures: euery one choſe his owne place of ſeruice: were he neuer ſo vnworthy, if he liked it better hee was deputed to the citty ſeruice: againe thoſe which were fit were ſuffered, if they liſted to remaine in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate among the Legionary or Auxiliary ſoldiers: which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe were willing to doe being moleſted with ſickneſſes, and not able to endure the heat of the countrey. Notwithſtanding the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Aydes were drawen of their principall ſtrength, and the beauty of the Praetorian campe blemiſhed, by this confuſion rather then choiſe of twenty thouſand out of the whole army. As Vitellius was making a ſolemne ſpeech, the ſouldiers required Aſiaticus, and Flauius, and Rufinus, captaines of France to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, becauſe they had taken armes in Vindex behalfe: neither did Vitellius reſtraine ſuch ſpeeches, beſides that he was a man of weake reſiſtance by nature, knowing alſo that the day of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue was at hand, and the money wanting. Wherefore he granted liberally all other requeſts to the ſouldier: and to ſupply that defect the freedmen of the former Princes were commanded to contribute, according to the number of their bondmen: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Vitellius without other care, ſaue onely to waſt and conſume, builded vp ſtables for charet driuers, filled the Race with ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of fencers and wilde beaſtes, and as in greateſt abundaunce

                     <hi>XXVIII.</hi> The preparation of Vitellius againſt Veſpaſian.</head>
                  <p>THE reuolt of the third Legion was firſt of all other certefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Vitellius by letters, written by Aponius Saturninus, before that he alſo aſſociated himſelfe to Veſpaſians ſide. But neither did Aponius write all, as a man afrighted with the ſodainneſſe thereof, and beſide the frendes of Vitellius flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ſought to extenuate and leſſen the matter: that it was but a mutince of one Legion alone; a matter of noe moment, ſeeing all other armies remained in obedience. After the ſame ſtile Vitellius alſo ſpake to the ſoldiers, inueying againſt the lately caſſed Praetorians, by whome hee affirmed falſe rumours were ſpred, and that there was no danger of ciuill warre, ſuppreſſing the name of Veſpaſian, and ſetting vnderhand ſouldiers abroad
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18156:63"/> in the towne to reſtraine the ſpeeches of the common people: which thing was a principall meanes to nouriſh the fame. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he ſent for Aydes out of Germanie and Britannie, and the Spaines, coldly and diſſembling the necesſity: the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and prouinces on their partes vſed the like coldneſſe againe. Hordeonius Flaccus Lieutenant of Germanie ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting already the reuolt of Batauia, had a warre of his own to care and prouide for. Vectius Bolanus gouerned in Britannie, a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey neuer ſo in quiet, that hee could conueniently ſpare any number of ſouldiers: and beſide neither of them were greatly faſt to the ſide. Out of the Spaines alſo ſmall haſt was made: at that time there was no Lieutenant generall there, but onely the Lieutenants of three Legions, of equall autoritie; who as in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius proſperity they would haue contended who ſhould haue bene formoſt, ſo now in his declining eſtate they equally drew backe. In Africke the Legion and cohorts leuyed by Clodius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and ſtraightwaies diſmiſſed by Galba, beganne by Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius commaundement to reſume their ſeruice againe: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the whole youth of the prouince voluntarily gaue in their names to be ſouldiers: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> Vitellius had gouerned as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſull there with good integrity and liking, Veſpaſian with as much infamie and hatred of the cuntrey; and accordingly our allies preſumed, they would cary themſelues in the Empire: but the triall was otherwiſe. And at the beginning Valerius Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus the Lieutenant furthered faithfully the endeuours of thoſe of the prouince: but anone he faultred, in letters and edicts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly pretending Vitellius, and with ſecrete meſſages intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Veſpaſian; meaning to defende the one ſide, or the other, according as they ſhould happen to proſper. Some Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſouldiers were taken in Rhoetia and France with letters and edicts of Veſpaſian about them, and being ſent to Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us were ſlaine: but more eſcaped pasſing vndiſcouered by the ſecretneſſe of frendes, or by their owne ſhifting. So the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Vitellius were knowen abroade: Veſpaſians purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were for the moſt part vnknowen, partly through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Vitellius, and partly becauſe the Pannonian Alpes were kept with garriſon, which ſtayed all meſſengers: and at ſea the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> Eteſians blew, a good wind to ſaile eaſtward, and contrary from thence.</p>

                     <hi>XXIX.</hi> The ſetting forth of Caecina againſt the Jlly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian armies, and the beginnings of his treaſon.</head>
                  <p>AT length Vitellius terrified with the breaking in of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vpon the frontiers of Italie, and feareful meſſages from euery quarter, commandeth Caecina and Valens to make ready for the warre. Caecina was ſent before, but Valens ſtayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde by reaſon of his weakneſſe in body, being lately recouered of a dangerous ſickneſſe. Nowe the German army going out of the citty made a farre other ſhew then it did at the entry. No quickneſſe appeared in their bodies, no courage in their mindes; marching ſlowly and thinnely: the armour decayed, the horſes vnluſty: the ſouldier impatient of the ſunne, the duſt, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the more dull to ſuſtaine trauell, the apter to mutin. And beſide, the qualities of Caecina wrought no ſmall preiudice to the cauſe: his ambitious and populare proceeding, an old fault of his: a ſluggiſh and dull diſpoſition, lately ſprung vp: whether it were that too much fauour of fortune turned his edge &amp; cauſed him to degenerat to riotous life, or that intending euen then treaſon in his minde, he thought it good pollicy by that meanes to weaken the valure and force of the army. Many haue beleeued that Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes minde was ſhaken and altered firſt by a practiſe of<note n="a" place="margin">Brother to <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and Prouoſt of Rome.</note> Flauius Sabinus, Rubrius Gallus carying the meſſage between them, and promiſing that Veſpaſian ſhould ratify all couenants made and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in caſe of reuolt: and withall he was put in remembrance of the hatred and emulation betweene Valens and him, and that ſeeing he had not like part in Vitellius, he ſhould doe wiſely to purchaſe credit and might with the new Prince. Caecina taking his leaue of Vitellius, and diſmiſſed from his preſence with great honour, ſent part of his horſemen before to put themſelues in Cremona. Straight after the Vexillaries followed of the<note n="b" place="margin">Reade fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, one of the foure Legions of lowe <hi>Germany.</hi> for the 14 was ſent away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Britanny p.</hi> 90. as enemy to <hi>Vitellius</hi> cauſe.</note> four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and of the ſixteenth Legion: then the fifth Legion and the eighteenth Legion: and laſtly the one and twentieth ſurnamed Rapax, and the firſt called Italica with the Vexillaries of the three Brittiſh Legions, and the choice of the Aides. When Caecina was gone, Fabius Valens wrote to the army, which before belonged to his charge, to ſtay for him in the way: that ſo it was agreed betweene him and Caecina: who being preſent, and therefore of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18156:64"/> greater autority, falſely alledged, that vpon later aduiſe that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was changed, to the end that reſiſtance might be made with the whole forces vnited againſt the enemies comming. So the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were commanded to make ſpeede to Cremona, and part to go to Hoſtilia. Caecina himſelfe turned out of the way to Rauenna, vpon pretence to giue direction to the nauy: and ſo to Padoua, where ſecretly the treaſon was contriued betweene Lucilius Baſſus and him. For Lucilius Baſſus after the captaineſhippe of a wing, being made Admirall of both the fleets at Rauenna and Miſenum, becauſe he was not by and by created captaine of the Garde, reuenged his vniuſt anger with wicked diſloyalty: neither can it be certainly knowen, whether he drew Caecina into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the ſame vile minde induced them both, as it happeneth often lewde perſons to be of like conditions. The hiſtories writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this warre, vnder Veſpaſian and his children, haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered falſe and flattering cauſes, as that deſire of peace and loue of the common wealth moued them thereto. To me it ſeemeth, beſide the inconſtant diſpoſition of the men, and the ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their faith, which once being falſed to Galba, afterward they neuer reſpected; that vpon emulation and enuy that others ſhould goe before them in the Princes fauour, they compaſſed the deſtruction of the Prince himſelfe. When Caecina had ouertaken the Legions, hee ſought by ſundry ſuttle practiſes to weaken the good wils of the Centurions, and of the ſoldiers which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately bent for Vitellius: Baſſus attempting the like founde not the like oppoſition, the nauy being eaſily induced to change their loialty, vpon the memory of their late ſeruice for Otho.</p>

They which perſwaded to ſtay for more ſuccour, &amp; protract the warre, amplifyed the ſame and force of the German Legions, &amp; further, that Vitellius had alſo brought with him the flower and ſtrength of the armie of Britannie: that their own Legions were both fewer in number, &amp; lately beaten; &amp; though they ſpake biggely, yet the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty ouercome retained the leſſe courage. But in the meane while if the Alpes were poſſeſſed Mutianus would ſhortly come on with the power of the Eaſt: and Veſpaſian beſide had at will ſea and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies, and the goodwill of the prouinces, ſufficient furniture for a new warre if need were: ſo by ſtaying a litle this aduantage would grow, that new forces would come, and the olde not diminiſh.

                  <p>NOW <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Antonius taking with him certaine Vexillaries out of the cohorts, and part of the horſemen, marched on towarde Italie, accompanied with Arrius Varus a valiant warrier rather then a vertuous man: which glory hee gained by his ſeruice and good ſucceſſe in Armenia vnder Corbulo: whom notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hee was ſuppoſed ſecretly to haue diſcredited with Nero. Whereupon by ſuch ſiniſter meanes growing in fauour he attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a principall Centurions place: which though ill gotten was at the preſent to his great contentation, but afterward turned to his ruine. Antonius and Varus in paſsing tooke Aquileia, and the countrey thereabouts, and proceeding forward were at Opiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium and Altinum ioyfully receiued. At Altinum a garriſon was left againſt the fleete of Rauenna, of the reuolt whereof they had not as yet receiued any intelligence: and marching forward they adioyned Padoua and Eſte to the ſide. Where aduertiſement was giuen that three Vitellian cohortes and the Scribonian wing lay at Forum Alieni, hauing there made a bridge ouer the riuer. It was concluded to take the occaſion, and to ſet vpon them as they lay negligently and careleſly; for that circumſtance alſo was certified: and ſo accordingly they came vpon them at the dawning of the day, and ſurprized them being for the moſt part vnarmed. They were willed before hande, that after ſome ſlaughter at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they ſhoulde ſeeke to induce the reſt with feare to chaunge their allegeance; and ſome there were which yeelded themſelues at the firſt: but the greater part fled ouer the riuer, and breaking the bridge cut off the paſſage from the enemy purſuing. This victorie beeing divulged, and the firſt attempts of the Flauianiſts hauing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18156:66"/> ſucceeded ſo proſperouſly, two Legions, the ſeuenth ſurnamed Galbiana, and the thirteenth called Gemina<note n="a" place="margin">And <hi>Titus Ampius Flaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall of <hi>Pannonia.</hi>
                     </note> with Vedius Aquila Lieutenaunt thereof, came to Padoua cheerefully, and ful of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. There ſome fewe daies were ſpent in repoſing the army, and Minucius Iuſtus campe-maſter of the ſeuenth Legion was ſaued from the fury of the ſoldier, and ſent to Veſpaſian, becauſe his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement was ſtraiter and more ſeuere, then the nature of a ciuill warre would ſupport. At what time alſo Antonius ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it a plauſible action, and for the credit of the ſide, if Galbaes gouernment ſhould ſeeme to be liked, gaue commandement tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out all the free townes, that the images of Galba, which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on change of times and diſſenſion in ſtate, had beene broken downe, ſhould be reſtored a new: a thing very long and greatlie deſired, and therefore interpreted gloriouſly in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Then was it propoſed and diſputed, what place were beſt to be choſen, for ſeate as it were of the warre. Verona ſeemed fitteſt, the countrey about it being champion, and commodious for horſemen, wherein conſiſted their principall ſtrength: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to diſpoſſeſſe Vitellius of a towne of ſuch wealth and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, would both be commodious and bring reputation to the cauſe. In the paſſage thitherward they tooke Vicenza a thing of it ſelfe not greatly materiall, as being a towne of ſmal forces; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit becauſe Caecina was borne there it ſeemed a matter of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; when men beganne to recount, how that the Generall of the contrary part had loſt his owne countrey and home: but the getting of Verona was worth the paines taking. For both the ſide was relieued with their wealth, and the example was a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to others: and the army lying there opportunely in the way, betweene Germanie and Vitellius powers, did ſhut vp the Rhoetian and Iulian Alpes, and cut of all hope of paſſage for the Germanes that way. All which proceeding was either vnknowen to Veſpaſian, or expreſſely forbidden by him: his commandement was to march no further then Aquileia, and there to expect Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus; adding alſo a reaſon thereof, that ſeing Aegypt, the garners of the citty, the reuenues and tributes of the richeſt prouinces were in his hands, Vitellius army might through lacke of pay and vittaile be conſtrained to yeelde. To the ſame purpoſe alſo Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus aduiſed them often by letters, alleadging what a glory it would bee to obtaine a victorie without bloud, and whereof no
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18156:67"/> mourning enſued, with ſuch other pretenſes; whereas hee did it indeede vpon ambition, and coueting to reſerue the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of the warre for himſelfe: but by reaſon of the greate diſtances counſailes came after the factes. Antonius hauing thus ſeated himſelfe in Verona iſſued foorth on the ſodaine, and gaue the alarme to the enemy, where trying their manhoode together in a light skirmiſh they departed on euen hand. Anone Caecina encamped himſelfe between Hoſtilia, a village of the territorie of Verona, and the mariſhes of the riuer Tartarus, in a ſafe and defenſible place; his backe being garded with the riuer, and the flanckes with mariſhes: who if hee had meant trueth, hauing all his maſters power vnder his hande, might with great facilitie either haue ſurprized two ſimple Legions (the army of Moeſia as yet being not ioyned) or at leaſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them backe, and forced them to flee, and with ſhame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Italie. But Caecina omitted traiterouſly all aduantages, which at the firſt were offered, ſpending the time in trifling delaies, and rebuking them by epiſtles, whome with like facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hee might haue repulſed with armes: vntill by meſſengers paſsing betweene the bargaine was driuen, and the couenantes for his treaſon agreed vpon. In the meane time Aponius Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus came with the ſeuenth Legion ſurnamed Claudiana: the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was gouerned by Vipſanius Meſſalla a Tribune, a man nobly deſcended, and of noble qualities himſelfe, the only vertuous man and without note, that entred into that action. To this army, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to his owne (for as yet there were but three Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions) Caecina ſent letters, blaming their raſhnes, that being once ouercome they durſt put themſelues againe into armes: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he extolled the valure of the German army; of Vitellius making ſmall mention and in common termes only, without any reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worde againſt Veſpaſian at all: in ſumme writing nothing that might either corrupt the enemie or terrifie him. The captaines of the Flauian armie, omitting to ſpeake of their former miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, returned anſwere concerning Veſpaſian in hawtie and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious termes, ſhewing themſelues verie confident in their cauſe and ſecure of the euent; reuiling Vitellius as enemies, and brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Moeſian armie, as being hitherto neuer ouerthrowen; ſeeking<note n="*" place="margin">Praeſumpſere parteis. <gap reason="foreign">

As in times paſt ſouldiers ſtroue to paſſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in modeſtie and vertue, ſo then the contention was to excell in vnrulineſſe and inſolency; the Moeſian ſouldier being loth to vſe leſſe violence in ſeeking the death of Saturninus their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, then the Pannonian were of Flauianus before: the Moeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſouldiers alleadged that they had helpt the Pannonians to proſecute their reuenge, and the Pannonian ſouldier, as if the ſedition of others would acquit them, were glad to ſee the like fault committed againe.

Lucilius Baſſus, Admiral of the nauy at Rauenna, had wunne to the Flauian ſide the mindes of his ſoldiers, being ſomewhat inclinable thereto of themſelues, becauſe the moſt of them were of Dalmatia and Pannonia, which cuntreyes held for Veſpaſian. The time for accompliſhing the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was appointed in the night, that whileſt the reſt knew nothing of the matter, they only of the conſpiracie might aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the Principia. Baſſus either for ſhame, or doubt what would be the iſſue, kept himſelfe within his houſe. The captaines of the galleyes in the meane time with great tumult brake downe Vitellius images: and ſome fewe which reſiſted being put to the ſworde, the reſt of the multitude vpon deſire of change was eaſily induced to fauour Veſpaſian. Then Lucilius comming abroade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed the whole fact as done by his autority, and the nauy in his place made choiſe of Cornelius Fuſcus for Admirall; who came with ſpeede thither: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Baſſus was conueyed by ſhip to Hadria, as it were vnder honourable arreſt, and by Mennius Rufinus cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of a wing being in garriſon there put in bandes; but ſoone after enlarged at the comming of Hormus Veſpaſians freedman, who was alſo in this warre counted among the Generals of that ſide.

Whileſt Antonius was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating what was to be done, Arius Varus, deſirous to doe ſome piece of ſeruice, brake out with certaine of the forwardeſt horſemen, &amp; made the Vitellianiſts recule, and ſlew ſome few: for by and by more of their fellowes comming to helpe, fortune changed, and they that were moſt forward before in purſuing, were now left laſt in the flight. This haſt was againſt Antonius will, who ſuppoſed the euent would be ſuch as it was: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it coulde not bee vndone he encouraged his men to fight valiantly: and diuiding his troupes in two parts, left a lane in the midle to receiue in Varus with his horſemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worde alſo was ſent backe to the Legions to arme, and the alarme was giuen to thoſe that were forraging abroade, that euery man ſhould leaue of ſpoiling, and repaire with all ſpeede the next way to the fight. Nowe by this time Varus in a greate feare was retired within his owne troupes, and induced thither a generall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wounded and vnwounded were beaten in together, and greatly diſtreſſed through their owne feare, and the ſtraytneſſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18156:70"/> of the wayes. In all which confuſion and tumult Antonius omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no parte either of a reſolute Generall, or valiant ſouldier, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging thoſe that were diſmayed, ſtaying them that ſhruncke; where moſt neede was, whence any hope appeared, there buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe, with direction, hand and ſpeech, in the view of the enemie, in the ſight of his owne men, growing at the laſt to that heate, that with his launce he ranne thorow a guidon bearer who was fleeing away, and taking his guidon turned it againſt the face of the enemie: whereat for very ſhame there ſtayed about an hundreth horſe. That which principally helped was the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the place, the<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> way being there ſomewhat narrow, and the bridge broken of the riuer that ranne behinde them, whoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen channell and ſteepe banckes ſtopped their further flight. That conſtraint or chance recouered the field that wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was loſt. For knitting themſelues ſtrongly together, with thicke and cloſe rancks, they receyued the Vitellian ſouldiers comming on looſely without any order. Which thing the leſſe it was loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, amazed them the more. Whereupon Antonius finding them yeelding preſſed the more inſtantly vpon them, ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that came in his way: and withall the reſt as their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, ſome fell to ſpoiling and catching, ſome to take ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and horſes: euen they which before were broken, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroade in the fields, hearing the ioyfull crye of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, returned then backe to take part of the victory. About fower miles from Cremona, the enſeignes of two Legions, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pax and Italica, appeared, hauing marched ſo farre vpon the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of their horſemen at the beginning: but when fortune tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they were ſo farre to ſeeke, as that they neither did open their ranckes, &amp; receiue their diſtreſſed fellowes within them, nor yet went forwarde to aſſayle the enemie tired already with fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and following ſo farre. Thus being by chance ouercome, they found in aduerſity the lacke of a leader, which in their iolity they cared not for. As the Legions ſtoode wauering in termes of breaking, the Flauian horſemen charged vppon them: and Vipſanius Meſſalla the Tribune was at their heeles with the Moeſian Aides, who in militare renowne, albeit lately enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, were nothing inferiour to the Legionary ſouldiers. So horſemen and footemen mingled together did eaſilie breake the Vitellian Legions, and the towne of Cremona lying ſo neare gaue
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18156:70"/> them leſſe minde to reſiſt, and more hope to eſcape: neither did Antonius preſſe any further, conſidering the trauaile and woundes, which both his horſemen and horſes had taken, in ſo dangerous a skirmiſh, albeit the ende went on his ſide. Toward the ſhutting in of the euening the whole power of the Flauian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my arriued: who aſſoone as they troad among the heapes of dead bodies, in the freſh ſteppes of ſo late a ſlaughter, as if the whole warre had bene ended, cryed to leade on out of hande to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona, and take by ſurrendre or force thoſe conquered perſons. Theſe gay ſpeeches were in their mouthes and openly preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but ſecretely euery one caſt thus with himſelfe; That a towne ſeated in the plaine might be wunne eaſily at a puſh; that their courage would as well ſerue them to enter in the night, and their liberty to ſpoile would then be much greater: but if they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till day, then would there come ſupplications and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for peace, and ſo for their labour and hurts they ſhould ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the vaine ſmokes of clemencie and glory, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther titulare matters, but the wealth and riches of the towne would cleaue to the captaines and Lieutenants fingers: that the ſpoile of a citty taken by force fell to the ſouldiers, but of a citty ſurrendred alwaies to the captaines alone. Hereupon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of the Tribunes &amp; Centurions, as perſons ſuſpect, were reiected: and becauſe no mans ſpeech ſhould be heard, they rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their weapons, threatening if no man would lead them beſide, to guide &amp; conduct themſelues. Then Antonius inſinuating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe among the common ſoldiers, after he had with the ſight of his perſon, &amp; reuerence of his place, procured ſilence, proteſted vnto them, that his meaning was not in any ſort to defraude ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing ſoldiers, either of honour or reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding the captaines and ſoldiers duties were of different nature: a ſouldier ought to be fierce and deſirous to fight, but in captaines a wary foreſight &amp; deliberate kind of proceeding is rather commended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more often times profiteth and helpeth hee by protracting, then venturing raſhly. For his parte as he had to his power with weapons and hande furthered the victorie, ſo would hee likewiſe helpe now with direction and counſaile, peculiare qualities to a Generall, and the place he ſuſtained. And ſurely if they liſt but a litle conſider, the dangerouſneſſe of the enterpriſe was very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. it was now night, the ſituation of the towne was vnknowen,

That terrour opened their mindes, which before were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt all their Generals good counſaile, and ſo he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the third Legion to make ſtand vpon the<note n="“" place="margin">or ridge.</note> cawſey of the Poſt-humian way: faſt by it on the left hand ſtoode the ſeuenth ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Galbiana in a plaine field: then the ſeuenth called Claudiana hauing before it a<note n="*" place="margin">agreſtis foſſa.</note> common ditch for a kinde of defence, as the place chanced to yeelde: on the right hande ſtood the eightth Legion in an open grounde: then the thirteenth in a thicket ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſunited by reaſon of buſhes and ſhrubbes. In this ſorte
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18156:71"/> ſtoode the ſtanderds &amp; enſeignes of the Legions, but the ſoldiers were blended together, as it chanced in the darcke. The bande of Praetorians ſtoode next to the third Legion, the Auxiliary cohorts were placed in the wings, and the horſemen garded the flanckes, and reareward: Sido and Italicus the Sueuians with the choiſe of their countrey men ſerued in the foreward. On the other ſide, the Vitellian army, whoſe beſt courſe doubtleſſe had bene to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſome reſt at Cremona, and refreſhed themſelues with foode and ſleepe, and ſo the next day to haue giuen the onſet vpon their enemies, ſtarued with hunger and colde, for lacke of a leader and want of direction, about the third hower of the night daſhed them ſelues vpon the Flauian army, who ſtoode now in array ſtrongly prepared to receaue them. The order and ſtanding of the Vitellian army I dare not for certaine auouch, being doubtleſſe diſordered through anger and darknes. Some affirme that the fourth Legion called Macedonica ſtoode<note n="*" place="margin">in dextro cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu.</note> in the right wing: the fift &amp; fifteenth Le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gions, with certaine companies out of three Brittiſh Legions, the ninth, ſecond, &amp; twentieth filled vp the middle battel; the left wing conſiſting of the tenth Legion, the two &amp; twentieth &amp; the firſt: the ſoldiers of Rapax and Italica diſperſed themſelues thorow out al: the horſemen and Aides choſe their owne ſtanding. The fight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued al night very doubtful &amp; cruel, with great mortality ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time on the one ſide, &amp; ſometime on the other: courage or ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth auailed litle in the darke, where the eie could not diſcerne a frende from an enemy. On both ſides was the ſame kind of armour &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: by many mutual queſtions ech knew others watchword: the banners alſo were mingled together, as it hapned a bande to take any from the enemy and cary them to and fro. The ſeuenth Legion lately leuied by Galba was preſsed moſt hardly: ſix of her principal Centurions were ſlaine, and ſome enſeignes taken away, the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd it ſelfe was hardly defended by Attilius Verus the chiefe Cen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turion; who with great ſlaughter of the enemy, and his own death in the end, notwithſtanding ſaued his charge. The Flauianiſts thus going to the worſe, Antonius reinforced &amp; ſtrengthned the battel by ſending for the Praetorian ſoldiers, who aſſoone as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the fight repulſed the enemy at the firſt, and anone were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed themſelues.

And after this and the like ſort he ſpake to all whom hee met: but moſt at large to thoſe of the thirde Legion, putting them in remembraunce both of their late and ancient victories; how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> vnder the conduct of Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us they had ouerthrowen the Parthians, vnder Corbulo the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, and of late the Sarmatians, then directing his ſpeech to the Praetorians in great anger: As for you diſgraded ſouldiers (quoth hee) it you winne not here, what other generall, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther campe ſhal receiue you? Yonder loe, there be your enſeignes and weapons, and preſent death if you leeſe, for you haue ſpente
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18156:72"/> already your ſhame. Great crying and noiſe there was on euery ſide, when as the third Legion, as the maner in Syria is, with a great ſhowte ſaluted the ſunne riſing: vpon which accident, or by the Generals pollicy, a generall rumour was ſpred thorow the hoſt, that Mutianus was come, and the armies had met and ſaluted ech other. Whereupon as ſupplied with newe forces, they preſſed forwarde and gaue a freſhe onſet, the Vitellian ranckes growing now thinner, as being without all direction, and banding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or disbanding as their owne courage or feare did induce them. When Antonius felt them weake in the ſhocke, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnder his hande, with a company firmely compacted hee charged and diſordered them. The ranckes once looſed brake, &amp; could not be reunited by reaſon of the cariages and engins, which hindered the matter. The conquerours hoatly purſuing the chace diſperſed themſelues along the high way. The ſlaughter was the more famous, becauſe in the ſame it happened the ſonne to kill his owne father: the thing and the names of the perſons I will ſet downe, as Vipſanius Meſſalla hath reported it. Iulius Manſuetus borne in Spaine, and called to ſerue in the Legion ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Rapax, left a ſonne at home vnder yeares, who growing afterward to mans ſtate, and being enrolled by Galba into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Legion, by mere misfortune here met and encountred with his owne father; and hauing wounded him deadly, going about to rifle him, came into knowledge of him, &amp; was likewiſe knowen by him againe. Whereupon embracing the corps, which now was without ſenſe or life, with teares &amp; lamentable voice he be ſought his fathers ghoſt, not to impute this impiety vnto him, nor abhorre and deteſt him as a parricide: that it was the publicke act of the cauſe: and what a ſmall portion was one ſouldier of theſe ciuill warres? And withall hee tooke vp the body, made a pitte in the ground, and perfourmed his laſt duety toward his father. This was perceiued by them which were next, and then by more alſo: in the end the fame of this ſtrange chance went thorow the whole army, &amp; much complaining there was, &amp; deteſtation of ſo cruell, and wicked a warre: and yet they continued nothing the leſſe to kill and to ſpoile both kinſmen and frendes, and euen their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alſo. they talke what a wicked fact was committed, and in the meane time commit it themſelues. Whenas they came to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona, there appeared a new and no ſmall piece of worke yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18156:73"/> For in the warre againſt Otho the German ſoldiers had caſt their campe about the wals of Cremona, &amp; about their campe ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

At the ſight whereof the Flauianiſts were at a ſtop, the Generals being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what to appoint. to begin the aſſault the army being tired with the trauaile both of the day &amp; the night, were a difficult matter, &amp; hauing no place of retiring at hand dangerous too: to returne to Bebriacu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were intolerable paine, the way being ſo long, &amp; beſides, all they had done would be loſt, and the victory made voide: to ſit downe &amp; intrench, that alſo were a thing ful of danger, &amp; to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, leſt the enemies being ſo neare ſhould ſally out, &amp; breed ſome diſorder as they were diſperſed, &amp; buſy at their work. But aboue al theſe reſpects the Generals ſtoode in moſt feare of their owne ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who would ſooner abide any danger, then any delay: all that tended to ſafety was vnſauory; in precipitation was their hope; the greedy deſire of the ſpoile made al killing, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, ſhedding their bloud to be matters of nothing. To this reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therefore Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius finally inclining, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to enuiron the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches with ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about.

Then with a ſtrong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> target fence ouer their heads they came vnder the walles, &amp; were receiued by thoſe that vnderſtoode that kind of ſeruice, as hauing benetrained vp in the ſame ſchoole, who rowled down huge ſtones vpon it, &amp; forced the frame to ſtagger &amp; fleete, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folowed &amp; ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into it with iauelins &amp; ſpeares, til the connexion of targets be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing diſſolued &amp; broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſlew or maimed the men.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18156:73"/> preuaile but a litle, ſhewed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the towne of Cremona, as the price of their victory. Whether this was Hormus deuiſe, as Meſſalla reporteth, or Caius Plinius be rather to be beleeued, who caſteth the fault vpon Antonius, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not eaſily determine; this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that whether Antonius or Hormus were autor of this moſt bad part, it was not vnſutable to neither of their former infamous liues, &amp; behauiours. But hereupon no danger of limme or life could ſtay the Flauian ſoldiers, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breaking down the trenches, &amp; beating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gates, euen with their ſhowlders; and ſome climing vp by a double target fence took hold on their enemies weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; caught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the armes: ſo the wounded &amp; not wounded, the halfe dead &amp; dying, came downe tumbling together, and periſhed ſome after one faſhion, and ſome after another, repreſenting al diuerſities of deathes. The ſeuenth &amp; third Legion fought moſt brauely, &amp; gaue the ſharpeſt aſſault, &amp; Antonius the General himſelfe, with the choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men of the Auxiliary ſoldiers, had bended his forces that way. The Vitellianiſts perceiuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues not able to ſuſtain any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger the force, &amp; fury of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo obſtinately bent, &amp; that whatſoeuer they caſt downe vpon them ſlid away vpon the target fence, without doing any harme, reſolued to rowle downe at the laſt a great<note n="*" place="margin">baliſta.</note> engine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they approched: which indeed for the preſent ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thoſe that were vnder, but withal in falling it drew the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with it, &amp; vppermoſt part of the rampier: &amp; at the ſame time a tower adioining being battered with ſtones fel downe. At which breach as the ſeuenth Legion aſſaied to enter, in a pointed battell, the third Legion in the meane ſeaſon brake downe the gate with their ſwords and axes. It is agreed vpon by al writers, that the firſt man which entred the trench was Caius Voluſius, a ſouldier of the third Legion, who preſently going to the rampier tumbled downe all that reſiſted, and aduauncing himſelfe in ſight proclaimed the campe was taken: and as the Vitellianiſts were now beginning to faint, and leape downe from the rampier, the reſt brake in. All the ſpace betweene the trenches and the towne was filled with deade bodies. And there againe appeared a new worke, and another la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: the walles of the citty were high, the towers all of ſtone, the barres of the gates of iron, the ſouldier ready with weapon in hande on the walles, the towneſmen manie and ſure to Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us; beſide a great number of ſtrangers aſſembled out of al places of Italie thither, by occaſion of a faire vſually holden there at
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18156:74"/> that time. But that as it was a helpe to the defendants in reſpect of the multitude, ſo was it a prouocation to the aſſailants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſpoile. Antonius commanded to take fire and burne certaine moſt goodly buildings, ſtanding without the walles, if peraduenture the towneſmen vpon the loſſe of their ſubſtaunce would be induced to yeelde. The houſes that were neare to the walles, and exceeded them in height, he repleniſhed with the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſt ſoldiers he had; who with blockes of timber, &amp; tiles, &amp; fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandes, bet away the defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts from the walles: by this time alſo, the Legions had caſt themſelues into a target fence, &amp; others ſhot ſtones, &amp; arowes againſt them on the walles. Then the Vitellianiſts hartes beganne by little and little to faile them, and euery man as he was firſt in degree was likewiſe the firſt to yeelde vnto fortune, leſt if Cremona alſo ſhould be taken there would bee no hope of pardon remaining, the whole wrath of the winners being like to turne not vpon the poore and beggerly ſouldier, but vpon the Tribunes and Centurions, by whoſe death ſome gaine might be gotten: contrarily the common ſoldier not ſearching into ſequels, and in leſſe danger by reaſon of his baſeneſſe, perſiſted ſtil for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius: and wandring in the ſtreetes, or hiding themſelues in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would not ſue for peace, euen then whenas they had left off to make warre. So the principall men of degree in the army razed Vitellius name, and defaced his images, and looſing Caecina, who then was in bandes, deſired him to become interceſſour in their behalfe. As he made dainty to doe it, and bare himſelfe proudly againſt them, they beſought him inſtantly euen with teares (a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all miſeries, ſo many valiant men to implore the aide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of a diſdainfull traitour) and then hung out ouer the walles their<note n="*" place="margin">Velamenta &amp; infulat.</note> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred veles and infules, in ſigne of ſubmiſsion. Whereupon Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius commaunding his men to ſurceaſe all hoſtility, they brought out their enſeignes and ſtanderds: the Vitellian Legions folowed; a heauy companie, vnarmed, and caſting their eies to the ground. the Flauianiſts cloſed about them, and firſt outraged them in ſpeeches, and ſeemed to threaten violence vnto them: but when they ſaw them not moued thereat, but patiently to endure all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, according to the circumſtance of their preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they beganne to call to remembrance, that euen thoſe were the ſelfeſame men, that had a little before at Bebriacum vſed their victory moderately. But when Caecina came forth as a Conſull
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18156:74"/> in his robes, with his ſergeants before him making way thorow the preſſe, the conquering ſouldiers loſt all maner of patience, obiecting vnto him his pride, and his cruelty; yea and his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too: ſo hatefull are vices euen where they are profitable. But Antonius interpoſed himſelfe, and ſent him ſafely garded away to Veſpaſian. In the meane ſeaſon the people of the towne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many armed men, were greatly annoyed, and they ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped nearely of a generall maſſacre, had not the captaines intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; ſomewhat appeaſed the ſoldiers wrath. Antonius calling a ful aſſembly made a ſolemne oration, ſpeaking in glorious termes to the ſoldiers of his own ſide, &amp; in curteous to thoſe of the other, concerning Cremona ambiguouſly. The army was doubtles ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly bent to the deſtruction and ſacke of the citty, beſide a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſire of ſpoile, vpon an olde conceaued diſpleaſure againſt them: for in the warre of Otho alſo they were thought to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedde and helped Vitellius ſide; and afterwardes the thirteenth Legion being left there to build an amphitheatre (as commonly theſe towneſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are naturally malapert) they had ieſted &amp; ſcoffed at them many other circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces made their caſe alſo the harder, as that Caecina had in that towne exhibited his ſhew of<note n="“" place="margin">Gladiatores</note> fencers in honour of Vitellius victory: that it was choſen now the ſecond time for the ſeate-towne of the warre: that they had helped the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellian army with vittailes: that ſome women were found ſlaine, which for extreme loue to the ſide had come out to the battaile: and not leaſt becauſe the faire time had filled the towne, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wealthy, with ſhew of more wealth. And thus ſtoode the ſoldiers for their part affected. As concerning the Commanders, the behauiours of the reſt were not much marked: Antonius by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of his fortune and his fame was principally eyed: who aſſoone as he entred the towne went preſently to the bath to waſh of the bloud, &amp; finding it ſomewhat too coole, let fall a word which was quickly taken vp, that ere long it would be made hoater. This baſe ieſt turned the whole blame vpon him, as if hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thereby a watchworde to ſet Cremona on fire, which to ſay the trueth was burning already. Forty thouſande armed men were broken in, and of ſeruants and followers of the campe both a greater number, and a great deale more diſordered in all kinde of licentious and cruell demeanour: neither age, nor honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calling could warrant any from violence, but without reſpect
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18156:75"/> of eyther they abuſed their bodies in villanous maner, and ſlew them indifferently. Aged men and olde women, nought worth to be ſolde, they haled in a iolity for paſtime and ſporte: if any mayde of competent yeares, or bewtifull yongman fell amongſt them, in ſtriuing who ſhould cary them away, they pulled them aſunder &amp; tare them in pieces; and thereupon growing in choler turned to kill one another. Whenas any had gotten and caryed away for himſelfe money, or the golde and iewels out of the temples, being met by a ſtronger, he left behinde him both his life and his bootie: ſome contemning that which they found ready and open, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the owners with torture and ſtripes, to confeſſe and yeeld vp their hidden riches, and treaſures buried vnder the ground. The ſouldiers walked with firebrands in their handes, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as they had emptied the goods, they hurled in a ſporte and wantonneſſe into the voyde houſes, and empty temples. And as in an armie diuerſe in language and manners, compounded of Romans, confederates, and ſtrangers, their luſts and deſires were diuerſe, and ſomething held lawfull by one, ſomething by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and nothing vnlawfull to all. Fower whole dayes Cremona miniſtred matter to ſacke and to burne: and all things beſide both holy &amp; prophane being conſumed into aſhes, the temple of<note n="a" place="margin">The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.</note> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitis without the walles remained vntouched, either becauſe it ſtoode out of the way, or by reaſon of ſome diuine vertue of the goddeſſe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> This end had the city of Cremona, two hundreth eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; ſix yeares after the foundation. It was built in the<note n="b" place="margin">In the yeare of the Citty 536. and the firſt yeare of the ſecond <hi>Punicke</hi> warre</note> yeare that Tiberius Sempronius &amp; Publius Cornelius were Conſuls, when Hannibal was about to come into Italy, for a bulwarke againſt the Frenchmen beyond the Po, and if any other power ſhould breake in by the Alpes. So by reaſon of the number of inhabitants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of riuers, fertility of the ſoile annexed, &amp; affinities contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with other people, it grew vp &amp; flouriſhed, in forraine warres vntouched, vnfortunate in ciuill. Antonius aſhamed of this foule act, which daily grew more &amp; more odious, made proclamation, that no man ſhould keepe any cittizen of Cremona as his lawfull priſoner: and all Italie with one generall conſent refuſing to buy any of them for ſlaues marred the ſoldiers market: who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon began to murther their priſoners. Which being once know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, their frendes &amp; kinsfolkes ſecretly came &amp; ranſomed them. In ſhort time after the reſt of the people returned to Cremona. The
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18156:75"/> publicke places and temples were reedified at the charges of the towneſmen, and vpon Veſpaſians ſpeciall encouragement. For the preſent, the ground being infected with the noyſomeneſſe of the dead carcaſes, ſuffered not the Flauian army to dwell long vpon the ruines of the razed citty. So they remooued three miles of, and there reduced the Vitellianiſts, being diſbanded, and trembling for feare, euery ſoldier vnder his colours, and anone afterward ſent them away into Illyricum, leſt during the time of the troubles they ſhould fortune to worke innouation. Into Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie and Spaine meſſengers were ſent with the newes of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: and for a proofe of their victory, into France they ſent Iulius Calenus a Tribune, and into Germanie Alpinus Montanus cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of a cohorte, becauſe Alpinus was of Triers, and Calenus an Aeduan, and both had followed Vitellius ſide: and withall they kept and fortified the paſſages of the Alpes with garriſons, fearing the deſcent of the Germans that way in fauour of Vitellius.</p>

Thus wallowing in ſloth, and languiſhing in the groues of Aricia, the heauy newes came vnto him of the treaſon of Lucilius Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and of the reuolt of the nauy at Rauenna: ſoone after the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull tidings mixed with ſome ioy concerning Caecina came, both that he had reuolted, and that he was put in bands by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.

About the ſame time the death of Iunius Bloeſus was openly knowen and much talkt of abroade: the circumſtances whereof, as we haue receaued them are theſe. Vitellius lying ſicke of a grieuous diſeaſe in the Seruilian gardens, chanced to eſpye in a turret not farre of many lights burning in the night ſeaſon, and demanding the cauſe, they about him made anſwere, that in Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Tuſcus houſe there was a ſolemne feaſt, &amp; much company met, whereof Iunius Bloeſus was the principall gueſt; amplifying the ſumptuouſnes of the entertainment, &amp; the mirth, &amp; the wanton ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing themſelues, and ſuch other matters farre aboue trueth: yea and ſome ſtucke not directly to accuſe Tuſcus himſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but aggrauated moſt againſt Bloeſus, that had ſo good ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and luſt in the Princes ſickneſſe, to banquet and paſſe the time ſo merrily away.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18156:76"/> diſlikes, that Bloeſus might be ouerthrowen, the promooting and proſecuting againſt him was committed to Lucius Vitellius: who vpon a ſiniſter emulation malicing Bloeſus (becauſe he was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a man, and himſelfe by deſert ſo infamous) entred into the Emperours chamber, and taking his little ſonne in his armes fell downe at his feete. When his brother demanded the cauſe of this his confuſion, I come not (quoth he) for any feare or care of mine own, but my humble ſuite is, &amp; theſe teares are ſhed in your owne behalfe, and your childrens.

Vitellius ſtanding in dreade betweene the feare of differring, and the open auowing ſo wicked a fact, leſt the one might breede his deſtruction, the other procure great enuy and ſlaunder, finally reſolued to attempt it by poiſon: the ſuſpicion whereof was ſtrongly confirmed, by his going in great ioy to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Bloeſus as he lay a dying; and moreouer a moſt ſauage ſpeech of his was ouerheard, wherein he vaunted (for I will reporte his owne very wordes) that he had fed his eies in beholding his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies death.

                  <p>IN the meane ſeaſon Fabius Valens marching forwarde, more ſlowly then was conuenient in going to warre, with a great and effeminate traine of concubines and eunuches, was aduertiſed in poſt of the treaſon of Lucilius Baſſus, with the loſſe of the nauy at Rauenna: and if he had followed with expedition his purpoſed iourney, hee might either haue preuented Caecinaes falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or ouertaken the Legions before the battaile was giuen. And ſome perſwaded him to take a fewe of his truſtieſt frendes, and ſo auoyding Rauenna by ſecrete bywayes to goe in all ſpeed to Hoſtilia, or Cremona: others were of opinion to ſende for the Praetorian cohorts out of the cittie, and ſo by ſtrong hande to make paſſage. But Valens vſing delay, to the great hurt of the cauſe, ſpent the times of action in conſultation: and then reiecting both the aduiſes, and taking a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> midle courſe, which in caſes of danger and doubt of all is the woorſt, hee neither was venturous inough with the one, nor prouident inough with the other, but onely wrote letters to Vitellius for ſome ſupply.

But Valens euen then, amidſt ſo great danger, abſtayned not from his olde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate liuing; but was diffamed, and noted to take by force his lewde pleaſures, and pollute his hoſts houſes, whereſoeuer he came, with adulteries and other vnlawfull luſts: he had both might and money, great meanes to induce; and the laſt luſts of fortune beginning to fall, now at the farewell ſhewed themſelues moſt outragious. When the horſemen and footemen were come, then appeared the weakneſſe and fault of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile. For neither could he with ſo ſmall a companie, though they had beene moſt truſtie, paſſe thorow the enemies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet were they faſt and truſtie indeede: but for a while ſhame, and the reuerence of their Generall beeing preſent, reſtrayned them, bondes of no long continuance with men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> greedie of dangers, and careleſſe of credit: vpon feare whereof Valens ſending the cohorts before to Ariminum, and appointing the wing to garde them behinde, with a fewe in his companie, whome aduerſitie had not altered, turned aſide
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18156:77"/> into Vmbria, and from thence into Etruria. Where vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the euent of the battaile at Cremona, hee entred into a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table determination, and if it had ſucceeded, of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; To betake himſelfe to the ſea, and ſetting on land in ſome part of the prouince of Narbon, to raiſe Fraunce and the nations of Germanie, and ſo ſtirre vp a newe warre. Aſſoone as Valens was gone, Cornelius Fuſcus came with an armie vppon them at Ariminum, and beſtowing his ſhippes not farre from the towne forced the ſouldiers for feare to yeelde, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe maſter of the plaine of Vmbria, and the countrey of Pice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num all along the ſeaſide: and ſo all Italie on the one ſide of the Apennine mountaines was vnder the ſubiection of Veſpaſian, and on the other ſide vnder Vitellius. Valens hauing embarked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the bay of Piſa was driuen by the violence of the ſea, or contrary windes, into the port of Hercules Monoecus. Not farre from thence Marcus Maturus Procuratour of the ſea Alpes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, a man verie faithfull and conſtant in Vitellius cauſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding al thereabout had declared themſelues for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſide; who intertaining Valens with all kinde of curteſie, and warning him, not raſhly to enter into the prouince of Narbon, with this admonition ſtrooke a terrour into his minde, and withall the reſt of the company beganne to faint for feare, and ſtagger in their allegeance.

The good will of the cuntrey went generally vpon the lawfull husband: but the queenes vntemperate affections were peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and violent in maintaining her minion. Whereupon Venuſius by the helpe of his other frendes, and the reuolt of the Brigantes, made warre vpon Carthiſmandua, and brought her into greate extremities: then praying aide at our handes, our cohortes and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18156:78"/> wings were ſent to defende her, which after ſundry skirmiſhes with diuerſe euent, deliuered her perſon out of peril, but the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome remained to Venuſius, and the warre vnto vs. About the ſame time our affaires in Germanie, through the inſufficiencie of our captaines, and ſeditiouſneſſe of our Legions, forreine force aſſailing vs, and our allyes betraying vs, were reduced to thoſe deſperate termes, that we ſtoode in danger of leeſing the countrey: but that warre together with the cauſes, and particular euentes thereof (for it continued long) I<note n="a" place="margin">

The Dacians alſo ſtirred, a nation neuer louing vs, and as then, our army being withdrawen out of Moeſia, not fearing vs neither. When the firſt alterations and troubles beganne, they held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues quiet, and looked but on: but whenas they perceiued Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to bee all in armes, and betweene the ſides euery where open hoſtility, forcing the ſtanding campes of the cohorts and wings, they put themſelues in poſſeſsion of both the banckes of Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, and were now at the point to baue razed the campes of the Legions, had not Mutianus, hauing knowledge before of the victory at Cremona, oppoſed the ſixt Legion againſt them, leſt two forreine powers ſhould haue broken in at one time, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans &amp; Dacians, from two diuerſe coaſtes. As often heretofore, ſo now ſpecially fortune was fauourable to the Romans, bringing Mutianus with the power of the Eaſt to arriue there at that inſtant; and that in the meane time the matter was ſo diſpatched at Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona. Mutianus departing away left Fonteius Agrippa, who had beene one yeare Proconſull of Aſia, Lieutenant generall in Moeſia; aſsigning him ſufficient forces out of the Vitellian Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom it was thought a point both of pollicy and peace to diſperſe abroad in the prouinces, and keepe occupied in forreine warre. Neither were other nations at quiet. In Pontus a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous bondeman, which ſometime had beene Admirall of the kings nauie, raiſed vp a ſodaine warre in the countrey: his name was Anicetus a freedman of the late king Polemo, ſometime of great credite and power, and now ſince the kingdome was<note n="b" place="margin">In Neroes time.</note> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a prouince diſpleaſed and greeued with the change. Whereupon hauing aſſociated vnto him in Vitellius name the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that dwell vpon Pontus, alluring the poore and needieſt ſort with hope of bootie and ſpoile, he became in ſhort time Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of competent forces; with which hee ſodainely inuaded and

Hee burned alſo the nauy there, doing his pleaſure on that ſea, which as then was vngarded, by reaſon that Mutianus had giuen order for the beſt of the galleyes, and all the ſouldiers to meete him at Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium: vpon occaſion whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> the barbarous people alſo of the countrey ranged abroade, and robbed without feare of checke or controlment; building them boates on the ſodaine, which they call<note n="a" place="margin">

Theſe things moued Veſpaſian to aſsigne vnto thoſe parts ſome Vexillary ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers out of the Legions, and Virdius Geminus for captaine, a man of good proofe in ſeruice: who ſetting vpon the enemies being in diſarray, and diſperſed in ſeeking of ſpoile, draue them to their boates, and then cauſing ſome galleyes to bee built in haſt, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ouertooke Anicetus in the mouth of the riuer Cohibus, being there vnder the protection of the king of the Sedochezi, whom he had wunne by money &amp; gifts to vndertake his defence.

Italie he harried as a conquered countrey: the Legions with all kinde of curteſie hee ſought to aſſure to himſelfe: in ſumme by all ſpeeches and deedes he made the way to his owne greatneſſe. And to giue the ſouldier the more his owne will, and leaue him the bridle at large, of his mere moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee graunted vnto the Legions the choiſe of Centurions in their roomes that were ſlaine: by which kinde of election the buſieſt and troubleſomeſt fellowes were choſen; and generally the ſouldier was not gouerned by the direction of his captaine, but the captaine drawen by the violence of the ſouldier. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe pointes tending to faction and corrupting of diſcipline, hee conuerted himſelfe to the pray, nothing dreading Mutia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus at hande, which was a more hainous offence, then to haue contemned Veſpaſian himſelfe. Neuertheleſſe the army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on, without cariages, becauſe the winter was neare, and the fieldes ouerflowen with the Po.

To this power were adioyned the beſt of the mariners at Rauenna requiring Legiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeruice, and in their roomes the Dalmatians were ſent to ſerue at ſea. At Fanum Fortunae the army and the leaders were at a ſtoppe, being in doubt concerning their principall purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had heard the Praetorian cohorts were already ſet forth out of Rome, and preſumed that the paſſages of the Apennine hilles were fortified and garded againſt them. But that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſt feare was want of prouiſion, in a cuntrey waſted and conſumed by warre, and the ſeditious cries of the ſouldiers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding<note n="*" place="margin">

It is reported by moſt credible writers, that among the winners there was ſuch a contempt of common honeſtie, and ſuch vnnaturall dealings againſt al lawes humane and diuine, that a common ſouldier among the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was not aſhamed, openly to profeſſe, that hee had ſlaine his owne brother in the laſt battaile, &amp; to require recompence for the ſame at the captaines handes: who neither willing to rewarde the fact in regarde of common humanitie, nor daring to puniſh it in reſpect of the nature of the preſent warre, differred the matter, pretending that he had deſerued much more, then they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently able to giue: howe it was ended I finde not recorded; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in former ciuill warres I finde the like to haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. For in the battaile fought againſt Cinna at Ianiculum, one of Pompeyes ſouldiers ſlew his owne brother, and when hee ſawe what he had done, ſlew himſelfe alſo, as Siſenna reporteth: ſo much haue our anceſtors exceeded vs, not onely in glory of their vertues, but in griefe for their faults. Theſe and the like drawen out of ancient hiſtory it ſhall not bee amiſſe to remember, where the place and matter requires to ſet downe either<note n="*" place="margin">exempla re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti, aut ſolatia mali.</note> examples of that which is good, or comforts for that which is bad. Now An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius and the Flauian captaines being at Fanum, thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18156:80"/> to ſende ſome horſemen before, and ſearch all the coaſt of Vmbria, to finde ſome eaſy and gentle paſſage ouer the Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine: and withall they determined to ſende for the ſtanderds and enſeignes, and all the ſoldiers that remayned at Verona, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the Po and the ſea with ſtore of prouiſion. There were of the Commaunders which ſought al meanes to delay: for Antonius was<note n="*" place="margin">nimius iam Antonius.</note> growen now too intollerable, and<note n="*" place="margin">certiora de Mutiano ſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur.</note> better hope was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of Mutianus: who being inwardly vexed that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was ſo ſpeedily gotten, and fearing vnleſſe he were preſent at the taking of Rome at the leaſt, he ſhould haue no part neither of the warre, nor the honour, wrote vnto Primus and Varus am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly, ſometime perſwading to follow with inſtance, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time diſcourſing of the profitableneſſe of delaying; framing his ſpeech in ſuch ſort, that if thinges fell out ill, hee would clearely diſclayme them, if well, he might take them vppon him: but to Plotius Griphus, whom Veſpaſian had lately made Senatour and Lieutenant of a Legion, and the reſt of his truſty frendes he gaue plaine direction to ſtay till his comming: all which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons returned vnto him a plauſible anſwere, and greatly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the heady proceeding of Primus and Varus. Thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Mutianus ſent to Veſpaſian, and ſo procured that Antonius deuiſes and doings were not accepted according to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which thing Antonius tooke very impatiently, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the fault thereof vnto Mutianus, by whoſe calumniations he conceyued his dangers had growen: neither did he forbeare to vſe hard ſpeeches againſt him, as a man of an intemperate toung, and not accuſtomed to acknowledge any ſuperiour. He wrote alſo letters vnto Veſpaſian in a more hawty and arrogant ſtile, then beſeemed a ſubiect to his Prince, with ſecrete glances and nippes at Mutianus: That it was Antonius and no body els, who firſt put in armes the Legions of Pannonia, and brought them into the field: that by his procurement and woorking the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Moeſia were firſt ſtirred vp to the warre: by his reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Alpes were paſſed, Italie poſſeſſed, and the ayde of the Rhoetians and German nations cut of: then, that Vitellius Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being at diſcord and diſperſed the vantage was ſpyed, and they ouerthrowen firſt by a furious charge of horſemen, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by a power of footmen for a whole day &amp; a night together; that was indeede the braueſt point of the ſeruice, and his only do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18156:81"/> as for the miſhappe of Cremona, it was a miſchance of warre; and that the deciding of other ciuill diſſenſions in former ages had coſt the common wealth much dearer, euen the ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of manie great townes. that hee ſerued his Prince not with ſending of meſſages and writing of letters, but with his perſon and weapon in hand: neither did he enuy or hinder their glory, that in the meane time had quieted Moeſia: they regarded the peace of Moeſia, and he the conſeruation and ſafety of Italie. by his perſwaſions France and Spaine, the moſt puiſſant parts of the Empire, were ioyned to the ſide: but all his paines and trauaile were in vaine, if they alone ſhould reape the rewards, which had no part in the perill. Mutianus was aduertiſed of all this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and there upon enſewed great enmitie, which Antonius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted ſimply and ſouldier like, but Mutianus cloſely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more irreconcileably.</p>

                  <p>BVT Vitellius hauing receyued ſo great a blowe at Cremona, concealing the newes, and fooliſhly diſſembling the matter, differred the remedies of his euils, not the euils themſelues. For if he would haue plainly confeſſed it, and taken aduiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, hee had both hope and ſtrength inough and too much remayning: but whenas contrarily hee fayned that all went on his ſide, by that vntrueth hee marred his owne caſe, and cut of from himſelfe all meanes of recouery. In his preſence there was no mention of warre, but a wonderfull ſilence that way: in the citty all ſpeeches of it were forbidden, which cauſed the more: and they, which if it had bene lawfull would haue tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nothing but trueth, being reſtrayned gaue out much more then it was. The captaines alſo of the Flauian ſide helped to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fame, carying Vitellius ſpies, as they chanced to take them, round about the campe, to ſee and view the ſtrength of their victorious army, and ſo diſmiſſing them backe to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. All which at their returne Vitellius, after ſecrete examination had, commanded to be made away. But aboue all other the<note n="a" place="margin">

For the performing whereof he ſought no corners, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelfe directly to Antonius, and openly profesſing what charge he had from his Prince, and what was his intent, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired hee might bee permitted to take a perfect ſuruey of all things. ſo ſome were ſent with him, which ſhewed him the place where the battaile was fought, the ruines of Cremona, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Legions. Agreſtis went home againe, and making rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whenas Vitellius would not beleeue his report, but char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with vntrueth, and further that he was hired thereto: Seeing then (quoth Agreſtis) no meane proofe will ſerue, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my life nor my death can now ſtande you in any other ſteede, I will giue you an aſſurance which you may beleeue; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from him, he ſealed his ſayings voluntarily with his bloud. Some write that he was ſlaine by Vitellius commaundement, but of his fidelity and conſtancy they report the ſame. Now Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius beeing as it were awaked out of ſleepe, commaunded Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Priſcus and Alphenus Varus with fourteene Praetorian co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, and all the wings of the horſemen to keepe the ſtreits of the Apennine. after them followed a Legion of Seamen; a power both for number and goodneſſe of men and horſes ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (if another had bene Generall) to make warre offenſiue, not onely to ſtande vppon their defence. The reſt of the cohorts were committed to Lucius Vitellius his brother to garde the citty withall.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> newe treaties and more gracious were concluded with our allyes, and the right of Latium conferred vppon ſtrangers. To ſome hee releaſed their tributes, to others he granted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, without all care of poſterity mangling and mayming the Empire. But the common ſort accepted theſe fauours that ſeemed ſo great, and the fooliſheſt bought them with money, which wiſe men accounted but voyde, beeing ſuch as could neither bee giuen nor taken with the ſafety of the ſtate. At the laſt through the inſtant requeſt of his armie lying in Meuania, with a great trayne of Senatours aſſumed, partly vpon ſuite and moſt vpon feare, he repayred to the campe irreſolute of himſelfe,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18156:82"/> and obnoxious to vnfaithfull counſailes. As he was ſpeaking to his ſouldiers in publike aſſembly, it fell out ſo many vnlucky birdes to flye ouer his head (a monſtrous matter) that the day was ouercaſt, as it were with a blacke cloude: and another no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> leſſe ominous and of euill preſage, that a bull which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be ſacrificed, brake away from the altars, ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the furniture of the ceremonie, and was knocked downe farre of from the accuſtomed place. But the greateſt monſter was Vitellius himſelfe, a Prince without skill in the profesſion of armes, and deuoyde of direction and counſell, demanding eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones of others in what order to march, what diligence was requiſite in making diſcoueries, what meane was to be obſerued in vrging, or delaying the warre, and vpon euery flying report apparently fearefull in countenance, and trembling in gate, and beſide all this moſt commonly druncken. At the length growing weary of the campe, and vnderſtanding of the reuolt of the nauy at Miſenum, hee returned to Rome, euer fearing moſt the blowe that came laſt, and careleſſe in the meane time of the mayne chance. For whereas it had bene a courſe moſt cleare in reaſon, and euident in ſight, to haue paſſed the Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine with his army, which then was in hart and ſtrength, and ſo to haue aſſayled the enemies almoſt conſumed with hunger and colde, he on the other ſide fell to<note n="a" place="margin">Taking ſome with him to Rome, but principally in that he ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with his brother, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none, ſix co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts &amp; fiue hundreth horſe into <hi>Campania</hi> out of this army.</note> diſperſing his forces, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned his beſt and faithfulleſt ſoldiers, whom he left thereby to the enemies mercy, and deliuered them as it were into their handes; contrary to the opinion of the moſt expert Centurions, who diſliked greatly the diſuniting, and if their aduiſe had beene asked, would haue tolde plainly their minde: but Vitellius inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt frendes hindered them from acceſſe, the Princes eares being ſo framed, that he accounted all ſharpe that was wholeſome, &amp; liked of nothing but that which was preſently pleaſant, and afterwards hurtfull. But the nauy at Miſenum (ſo much the audaciouſneſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of one ſingle man in ciuill diſſenſions may work) was brought to reuolt by the meanes of Claudius Fauentinus, a Centurion ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly caſſed by Galba, who counterfayting letters from Veſpaſian, with hope of reward induced them to change their allegeance. The Admirall thereof was Claudius Apollinaris, a man that neither conſtantly kept his fidelity, nor ſtoutly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his treaſon: and Apinius Tiro, who had bene Pretor, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18156:82"/> was then by chance at Minturnae, offred himſelfe for a head to them which reuolted; by whoſe meanes the colonies and free townes were drawen to the ſide, the Puteolani ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt forward that way. But Capua on the other ſide, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted firme to Vitellius: whereupon there paſſed, vnder coulour of the publicke cauſe, much priuate choler betweene the two townes. To the pacification of theſe troubles Vitellius choſe out Claudius Iulianus (who had lately bene Admirall of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie at Miſenum, and gouerned himſelfe in that charge with great mildneſſe) as the meeteſt man to appeaſe the ſouldiers mindes; asſigning vnto him a power of one cittie-cohort, and the<note n="“" place="margin">Gladiatores</note> fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which were vnder his charge. Aſſoone as the campes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the one to the other, Iulianus without any great ſtay turned to Veſpaſians ſide, and ſo iointly they tooke Tarracian, a place of great ſtrength in regarde of the walles and ſituation, if the men within had bene faithfull and good. Vpon knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Vitellius leauing part of his forces at Narnia, with the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of his Garde, ſent his brother Lucius Vitellius away with ſix cohorts and fiue hundreth horſe, to manage the warre of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania. Himſelfe beeing greatly perplexed in minde was yet ſomewhat reuiued with the earneſt goodwill of the ſoldiers, and clamours of the towne people requiring armour and weapons; whom being nought els but a cowardly companie, whoſe bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe neuer went beyonde wordes, he called by the falſe title of armies and Legions. At the perſwaſion of his freedmen (for of his frendes the greateſt men were leaſt truſty) he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the tribes to be called, and ſware them which gaue in their names: too many preſenting themſelues, he diuided the charge of the muſter betweene the two Conſuls, and aſſeſſed the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours at a certaine number of bond-men, and quantity of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The Gentlemen of Rome made offer both of their ſeruice and money, euen the Libertini requiring of their owne motion they might be admitted to doe alſo the like. This counterfayt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe made the offices, that were done for feare, be thought to proceede of goodwill. And indeede many pitied not ſo much the man, as the place he ſuſteined: &amp; Vitellius himſelfe ceaſed not by his countenance, ſpeech &amp; teares to prouoke compaſſion and pitty, promiſing largely, &amp; (as the nature is of men in great feare) without meaſure. Moreouer he tooke then vpon him (which he

                  <p>AS the poſſesſing of Meuania by the Vitellianiſts had wrought great terrour in Italie, ſeeing another warre as it were ſprung vp a freſh by that meanes, ſo of the contrary ſide the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Vitellius in ſo fearefull maner procured great credit, and good to the Flauian cauſe. For preſently thereupon the Samnites, and Peligni, and Marſi reuolted; and vpon emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Campania had preuented them, to recompence their ſlackneſſe, as men newly come to a new maſter, ſhewed extreme diligence in furthering the ſeruice. But in pasſing the Apennine the armie by the fowleneſſe of the winter weather was greatly diſtreſſed, and marching with all liberty and quietnes could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wreſtle out of the ſnowe, ſo that it was cleare to be ſeene, what danger they muſt needes haue ſuſtayned, if fortune, to which the Flauian captaines were more often beholding, then to their good guiding and skill, had not turned Vitellius backe home againe. In the mountaines Petilius Cerealis met them, who in clowniſh apparell through knowledge of the countrey had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped Vitellius handes. Cerealis was of neare affinity with Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, &amp; of ſome name for matters of warre, and therefore was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Leaders. Many write that Flauius Sabinus and Domitian might alſo haue eaſily eſcaped, and certaine it is, that diuerſe meſſengers ſent by Antonius by ſundry cunning ſleights came to their ſpeech, pointing the place, and offring them meanes for their ſafety: but Sabinus alleadged that his crazy body was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18156:83"/> not to vndertake a matter of that paines, and ſuch an audacious attempt. Domitian would gladly haue ventured, but hee feared the keepers whom Vitellius had ſet about him, although they offred to accompany him in his eſcape, leſt peraduenture it had beene a ſnare to intrappe him: and indeede Vitellius himſelfe, in regarde of his owne kinsfolkes, intended no cruelty againſt Domitian. When the Flauian captaines were come to Carſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, they ſtaied there a fewe daies to repoſe their army, till their Legionary power ſhould ouertake them: and the place of the campe in it ſelfe was delitefull, with a large goodly proſpect, and verie ſafe for the prouiſion of vittailes, hauing ſo manie of the welthieſt citties, as it were ſtore houſes behinde them. And beſides they were in ſome hope that the Vitellianiſts, which were not diſtant aboue tenne miles, would fall to ſome parle, and ſo from a parle to a reuolt: which thing the ſouldiers could not abide to heare of, but deſired an ende rather by conqueſt, then by peace: euen their owne Legions they were vnwilling to ſtay for, loath to haue more fellowes in the ſpoile, when they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded none in the danger. But Antonius calling them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie together, ſhewed vnto them, that Vitellius had yet ſome forces remayning, wauering perhappes and vnconſtant if they might haue time to conſult, but of fierce ſtomacke if they were driuen to deſpaire: that the beginnings of ciuill warres were to bee permitted to fortunes deciding, but the accompliſhment of the victorie was to bee gouerned by reaſon and wiſedome: that the nauie of Miſenum, and the moſt flouriſhing countrey of Campania were alreadie reuolted, and there remayned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of al the world vnto Vitellius, ſaue onely ſo much as lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Tarracina and Narnia: and ſurely they had wunne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſufficient in the battayle at Cremona, and blame too much by deſtroying the towne. therefore they ſhould not now deſire to take Rome, but rather to ſaue it: their rewarde would bee greater, and their glory moſt great, if they wrought the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Senate and people of Rome without bloudſhed. With theſe and other like ſpeeches their mindes were mollified, and ſoone after the Legions came. The Vitellian cohortes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the ſame of the armie ſo much increaſed, beganne to wauer, no man animating them to the warre, but manie to reuolt, who deſired to make a preſent of their bandes and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18156:84"/> cornets vnto the conquerour, to purchaſe fauour hereafter; and gaue alſo aduertiſement, that faſt thereby at Interamna was a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of fower hundreth horſe. Whereupon immediately Varus was diſpatched with a band of men lightly appointed, and ſlewe ſome fewe that made reſiſtance: but the moſt part laide downe their weapons, and yeelded themſelues to his mercy: ſome fled to the campe at Narnia, and filled all there full of feare and terror, extolling aboue trueth the forces and valour of the enemies, to diminiſh their owne diſhonour in loſing their fort. Neither was there any puniſhment for offences among the Vitellianiſts; on the other ſide the rewardes were apparent of thoſe that reuolted: ſo that from thence foorth the contention was, who ſhould bee moſt traitour, and daily ſome of the Tribunes and Centurions fled to the enemie: for the common ſouldier was obſtinately bent for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius, vntil Priſcus and Alphenus Generalles forſaking the camp vpon feare, and returning to Vitellius, diſcharged the reſt from all blame of treaſon. About the ſame time Fabius Valens was put to death in the priſon at Vrbine. His heade was openly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Vitellian cohortes to put them out of all hope: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they beleeued that he was eſcaped into Germanie, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in armes both olde and newe ſouldiers there: but when they ſawe he was dead they beganne to deſpaire. The Flauian armie alſo tooke a wonderfull conceite as if his death were vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ende of the warre. Valens was borne at Anagnia, of a gentlemans houſe, looſe in conditions, and not without grace in ſeeking by wanton ieaſtes the name of a pleaſant conceite. In the games of Iuuenalia in Neroes time hee<note n="*" place="margin">Mimos acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavit.</note> plaied a part, firſt as it were by compulſion, then voluntarily, with more dexteritie then credit. Being created Lieutenant of a Legion hee both ſought to preferre Verginius to the Empire, and then to diſcredit him. Fonteius Capito his Lieutenant generall, either becauſe hee was entred into treaſon, or becauſe he could not induce him to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he murdred and made away. A traitour he was no doubt to Galba, and true to Vitellius, a vertue in him ſo much the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, becauſe ſo many others were falſe. Now the Vitellian ſouldiers ſeeing all their hope cut off, going to yeelde themſelues to the contrary part, euen in that alſo had a care of their honour, and came downe into the plaine vnder Narnia vnder their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignes and banners diſplaied: the Flauian army ſtoode armed

So the Vitellianiſts were receiued into the middle, and being ſo incloſed about, Antonius intertained them with comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and gracious wordes, and appointed ſome of them to abide at Narnia, and ſome at Interamna, leauing ſome of his owne Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions withall, without moleſtation to them if they were quiet, and yet of force ſufficient to repreſſe them if they rebelled.</p>

                  <p>DVRING their abode at Carſula, Antonius and Varus ſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall meſſages vnto Vitellius, offring him, if he would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe armes, and yeelde himſelfe and his children to Veſpaſians mercy, life, money, and what ſecret place he would chuſe of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania to retire himſelfe into: to the ſame effect Mutianus wrote alſo vnto him: and Vitellius oftentimes gaue eare thereunto, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into ſpeech about the number of his ſeruants, and the choiſe of the place. So great a ſenſeleſneſſe had poſſeſſed his minde, that if other men had not remembred, that he had beene once Prince, and therefore was not to looke for ſecurity in priuate eſtate, hee himſelfe would haue quickly forgotten it. But the principall men at Rome ſecretely incited Flauius Sabinus being Prouoſt of the citty, to put himſelfe into the cauſe, and vndertake part of the victory and of the honour: making remonſtrance vnto him, that the citty cohortes was his owne peculiare ſouldier, the cohortes of the Watchmen would queſtionleſſe take his part, and their own retinue of bondmen ſhould bee at his diſpoſition, beſide the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the ſide, and the eaſy courſe of proceeding they finde, that be in traine of winning. that hee ſhould not yeelde the honour of the action to Antonius and Varus: that Vitellius had but fewe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts in number, and thoſe diſcouraged and trembling at the euil newes that came out of all quarters: the common people was fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle &amp; changeable; &amp; if Sabinus would preſent himſelfe for a head, they would vſe the ſame flattering termes for Veſpaſian, which now they did to the other. as for Vitellius hee was a man not able to gouerne himſelfe in proſperity, much leſſe ſufficient to wielde and winde out of his declining eſtate: that the honour of finiſhing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18156:85"/> the warre would be his, who firſt ſhould take poſſeſsion of the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſo were it fit in al congruity, both for Sabinus to reſerue the Empire to his brother, and for Veſpaſian to eſteeme of all other mens ſeruice ſecundarily to Sabinus. Theſe warlike ſpeeches made but a ſlender impreſsion in his feeble olde minde, and ſome did ſecretely ſuſpect and charge him, that through enuy and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hee ſought rather to hinder his brothers good fortune. For Flauius Sabinus was the elder brother, and exceeded Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian both in riches and authority, whiles they were both priuate men, and was thought to haue ſaued his credit, and kept him from breaking, by lending him money, but taking in morgage his houſe and landes for repayment thereof: whereupon albeit in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhewe they continued frendes, yet ſome ſecrete ielouſies were feared betweene them. But the better interpretation was, that being a milde man he abhorred from ſlaughter and bloud, and therefore treated diuerſe times with Vitellius of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able compoſing of matters vpon conditions. And after diuerſe meetings at his houſe, at the laſt a capitulation was concluded vpon (as the fame went) in the temple of Apollo, onely two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Cluuius Rufus and Silius Italicus, beeing<note n="a" place="margin">Salutem ſibi &amp; millies HS. a Flauio Sabino Veſpaſiani fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre pepigit, <hi>ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> Suet.

And if Vitellius could as eaſily haue perſwaded his frendes, as he was ready to yeelde himſelfe, Veſpaſians army had entred the city without bloudſhed: but the loial &amp; faithful ſeruants of Vitellius flatly reiected all ſpeech of peace and conditions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the danger and diſhonor thereof, &amp; that the performance conſiſted only in the winners good pleaſure. Nay, ſaid they, Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſian wil not be ſo confident, as to ſuffer Vitellius to liue, though in a priuate eſtate: or if hee would, yet your very owne ſouldiers and frends will not abide it: and ſo through their pitty your life ſhall come in danger. You are old, and therefore for your part, as one that hath had his fil of both fortunes, are content to accept of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; but what title and ſtate ſhal your little ſonne Germanicus haue? now they offer money, ſeruants, and the pleaſant places of Campania to ſolace you in: but when Veſpaſian ſhall once be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Empire, neither he, nor his frends, nor his ſouldiers will thinke themſelues ſafe, while ſo great a concurrent doth liue. Euen Fabius Valens, whom they had in priſon, and reſerued in ſtore if
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18156:85"/> ought ſhould goe wrong, was too heauy for them to endure: much leſſe are wee to thinke, that Antonius and Fuſcus, and the chieffe flower of the ſide Mutianus, will otherwiſe deale with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius, then to make him away. Caeſar left not Pompey aliue, nor Auguſtus Antonius: vnleſſe perhaps Veſpaſian carry a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer minde, the meaneſt among many of your fathers followers and clients, when hee was fellowe in office with Claudius the Emperour. nay rather as it beſeemeth you being ſonne of a thriſe Conſull and Cenſor, as it becommeth ſo many honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble titles of your moſt noble houſe, let deſpaire at the leaſt arme you to courage and boldeneſſe. The ſouldiers perſiſt ſtill for you: the good will of the people continueth yet very feruent: in ſumme no greater harme can happen, then that which we runne into voluntarily dye we muſt if we be ouercome, and dye we ſhall if we yeelde: the difference onely is this, whether wee ſhould ende our liues vertuouſly and with honour, or with ſhame and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reproch.

To this charge Vitellius in great feare made anſwere, with ſome words in excuſe of himſelfe, &amp; laying the blame vpon his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whoſe too much vehemency, his modeſty, he ſayed, was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bridle; &amp; withall aduiſed Martialis to conuey himſelfe out of the houſe by a priuy way, leſt the ſoldiers ſhould murdre him as a negotiatour of the peace, which they ſo greatly deteſted: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Vitellius was now but a cipher, neither able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande nor forbid, not Prince in effect, but only matter of warre. Martialis was ſcarce returned into the Capitoll, whenas the Vitellian ſoldiers, in a great fury were alſo at hand, without any leader or captaine, but euery man of his owne head: leauing with ſpeede the Forum and temples vpon it behinde them, they ſet themſelues in array &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched vp the hil, euen to the firſt gate of the Capitol. There were in olde time certaine open galleries vpon the ſide of the cliffe, on the right hande as a man goeth vp: from the toppes whereof the defendants with ſtones and tiles bet the Vitellianiſts downe, who had in their hands nothing but ſwordes, and to ſtay while engins &amp; ſhot were fetched ſeemed loſt time: wherefore they tooke fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands and hurled them into the vttermoſt gallery, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fire were at the point to haue entred the gate of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll being halfe burned, had not Sabinus pluckt downe all the images and glorious monuments of our progenitours, and in the entrance of the gate made as it were a countermure of them. Then they aſſayed to make their entry on the other ſide of the Capitol by Lucus Aſy li, and by the Stayres of a hundreth ſteppes, in the aſcent to Rupes Tarpeia. At both theſe places the aſſault came vnlooked for, but the nearer &amp; hoater was that by the Aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum: neither could they be ſtopped from climing vp by the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that touched together, which as in a time of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g peace were rayſed to the height of the floore of the Capitoll.

That building then was fired, which diſmayed more the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants then the aſſaylers. for the Vitellian ſouldiers lacked nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther skill, nor reſolution in caſes of difficulty: but of the other ſide, the ſouldier was fearefull, the captaine without courage, and as a man halfe diſtract, had neither the vſe of his toung, nor his eares, not gouerning himſelfe by the aduiſe of others, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18156:87"/> yet not able to reſolue of himſelfe, but running about from one place to another, at euery cry of the enemie, forbad that hee had commanded, and commanded againe that he had forbidden. Anone, as it happeneth in loſt &amp; deſperate caſes, euery man was a commaunder, and no man a putter in execution: at the length ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away their weapons, they beganne to deuiſe how to flee and eſcape ſecretely away. Then the Vitellianiſts brake in and killed, burned, and ſlue: ſome fewe militare men that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fight were ſlaine: among whom Cornelius Martialis, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius Pacenſis, Caſperius Niger, Didius Scaeua were the moſt of note. Flauius Sabinus was beſet and taken, beeing neither armed, nor attempting to flee, and Quintius Atticus the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull, a man of ſpeciall marke by reaſon of his office, and through his owne vanity and follie, hauing publiſhed edicts in honour of Veſpaſian, and to the diſgrace of Vitellius. The reſt made ſundry ſhifts to eſcape, ſome in bondmens apparell, others were hidden by their clients, and conueyed away amongſt the ſtuffe: ſome there were alſo that had learned the Vitellianiſts watch-worde; whereby one of them knewe another, and ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and anſwering accordingly, vſed boldneſſe in liew of a hole to lurke in. Domitian at their firſt breaking in was hid in the ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens houſe, and there by the pollicy of his freedman put in a linnen garment, as the miniſters of the temple did weare, and ſo eſcaped vnknowne, and lay ſecrete at the houſe of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Primus, one of his fathers followers, neare to the Velabrum. Afterward when his father came to the ſtate he pulled downe the ſextens lodging, and builded there a little chappell in honour of <hi>Jupiter his Preſeruer:</hi> and alſo erected an alter and cauſed this hiſtory to bee cut in marble: and when hee came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire himſelfe he built a great temple to <hi>Jupiter his Keeper;</hi> and conſecrated himſelfe in the lappe of the god. Sabinus and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus being loaden with irons, and brought to Vitellius, were neither receiued with il ſpeech, nor ill countenance; whereat they which challenged to kill them, &amp; reward for their ſeruice, fretted and chaffed: and ſo the next beginning the cry, the raſcal ſort of the people demanded Sabinus death, mingling threats and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries together. And as Vitellius preſented himſelfe vppon the ſtayres of the palace to intreate for his life, they forced him in the end to deſiſt: then they ſtabbed and mangled him, and cutting of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18156:87"/> his head trailed the body into Gemoniae. This was the end of Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, a man ſurely not to be contemned. He had ſerued in publicke place thirty fiue yeares, and was greatly renowned both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of peace and of warre: for integrity &amp; vpright dealing no man could touch him: ſomewhat he was too full of wordes; the only thing blamed in him during the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares that he ruled in Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, &amp; the twelue yeares that he was prouoſt of the citty: in this laſt act of his life ſome iudged him cowardly, others moderate rather and ſparing of his citizens bloud; but of this all men agree that before Veſpaſian was Prince, the reputation of the houſe reſted in Sabinus. It was thought that Mutianus was glad of his death: and many were of opinion, that it fell out not ill in reſpect of quietnes, al ſtrife &amp; emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being thereby taken vp betweene two, wherof the one was the Emperours brother, &amp; the other caryed himſelfe as his fellow.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18156:88"/> men, to deliuer ſecretly the caſtell being vnmanned, &amp; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the dead of the night hee brought certaine light armed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, into the place ſtanding vpon the top of a hill, ouer the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies head. From thence the ſoldiers ran down rather to a butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a battaile, killing ſome vnarmed, others beginning to arme, ſome newly awaked out of ſleepe, diſtracted &amp; confounded with feare, darkneſſe, the ſound of trumpets &amp; noyſe of enemies. A few of the<note n="“" place="margin">Gladiatores</note> fencers made reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; were ſlaine, albeit they ſold their liues deare: the reſt ranne headlong to the ſhippes, where through the like feare all things were in the like confuſion; or ſo much the more becauſe the towneſmen were gotten in amongſt them, whom the Vitellianiſts alſo did kill without any difference. Six ſhippes vppon the firſt notice of the ſurpriſe eſcaped, and with them Apollinaris the Admirall of the nauy: the reſt were either taken vpon the ſhoare, or els ſuncke in the ſea, being ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the company that leapt into them. Iulianus was brought to Lucius Vitellius and ſcourged, then ſlaine in his preſence. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe haue accuſed Triaria Lucius Vitellius wife, that girding hir ſelfe with a ſworde like a ſouldier, ſhe ſhould haue demeaned hir ſelfe cruelly, and inſolently amidſt the pitifull cryes, &amp; lamentable deſtruction of the poore towne. Lucius himſelfe ſent a lawrell in token of victory to his brother, requiring withall his further plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whether he ſhould returne preſently to Rome, or ſtay &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the reſt of Campania: the interpoſing of which litle time fell out greatly for the good both of Veſpaſians ſide, and of the ſtate. For if the ſoldiers preſently after their victory had directly repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Rome, whiles they were in courage and hart, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their late good ſucceſſe, beſide a naturall obſtinateneſſe in them, the matter would not haue bene ended ſo quickly without much adoe, and the euident deſtruction of the citty. For Lucius Vitellius albeit he were infamous otherwiſe, yet was he induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and powerable not as good men by vertues, but by vices as the worſt ſorte.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18156:88"/> Antonius, as done with a traiterous intent, vpon letters receiued from Vitellius, wherein he offred vnto him the Conſulſhip, and his daughter in mariage with a great dower, if hee would reuolt, in rewarde of treaſon: others affirme, that all this was falſely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and maliciouſly ſpred to pleaſe Mutianus withall. Some are of opinion, that it was the purpoſe of all the Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders rather to put the citty in feare, then to ſeeke to take it by force, ſeeing the moſt and principall cohortes had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed Vitellius, and now all his ſtrength being cut off, it was likely he would reſigne the Empire without further coaction: but all that courſe was croſſed, firſt by Sabinus haſt, and then through his cowardlineſſe; who raſhly taking armes was not afterwarde able to keepe a fortreſſe of that ſtrength, and which euen great armies could not haue taken, againſt three onely cohorts. But the fault cannot well bee imputed to one, which was common to all. For both Mutianus was ſome occaſion of ſtay, by meanes of his doubtfull letters, and Antonius by his prepoſterous obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in ſeeking to auoide enuy, deſerued great blame, and the other Commaunders preſuming the warre to bee finiſhed, made the ende of it more notorious. Neither did Petilius Cerealis (who was ſent before with a thouſand horſe, to coaſt through the cuntrey of the Sabins, and ſo to enter the citty by Via Salaria) make that haſt as the matter required, till in the ende the newes of the ſiege of the Capitoll made them ſtirre al at once. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius came forward by the Flaminian way to Saxa rubra late in the night, &amp; too late to ſuccour. For there he vnderſtood that Sabinus was ſlaine, the Capitol burned, the city in great feare, and al things went il: it was alſo declared, that the people and bondmen were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for Vitellius. And beſides Petilius Cerealis had receiued a blowe in a skirmiſh of horſemen, by running headlong and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging raſhly vpon the enemy, preſuming them conquered perſons: but the Vitellianiſts, with horſemen and footemen interlaced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, valiantly receiued the charge. This skirmiſh was not farre from the citty, among the buildings, and gardens, and croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes, wherewith the Vitellianiſts were well acquainted, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not: which was an occaſion to diſmay them the more: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all their horſemen were not of one minde and affection, ſome being of thoſe that hauing lately yeelded at Narnia kept aloofe, meaning afterward to cloſe with the winner. Tullius Flauianus
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18156:89"/> captaine of a wing was taken priſoner, the reſt ranne away diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably: but the Vitellianiſts purſued no further then to Fidenae. By this ſucceſſe the affection of the people was greatly augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; immediately the towneſmen tooke armes: few had any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litare targets, but the moſt tooke vp whatſoeuer weapons came to their hands, and forthwith required the ſigne of the battel. Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius thanked them hartily, &amp; willed them to iſſue out with al ſpeed in defence of the citty. Then he called a Senate wherein Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were appointed to the armies, which as in the name and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of a common weale, ſhould perſuade them to peace and agreement. The hap of the Embaſſadors was not al alike: For they which met with Petilius Cerealis incurred extreme da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, the ſoldiers refuſing vtterly al conditions of peace, and Arulenus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus the Pretor was wounded, which beſide the enormity of the fact, in the perſon of an Embaſſadour and a Pretor, was alſo more hainous, in regard of the worthineſſe of the man. His traine was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, and one of his ſergeants next before him ſlaine, for preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming among armed men to make way thorow the preaſe for his maſter: and vnleſſe they had beene defended by a bande that the captaine aſsigned to garde them, the right &amp; priuiledge of Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, reputed ſacred euen among ſtrange nations, had through ciuil fury bene violated by murder, euen at the very gates &amp; wals of the citty. But they which came to Antonius found more curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainement, not becauſe thoſe ſouldiers were ciuiller, but becauſe the General was of greater autority. Into the company of theſe Embaſſadors Muſonius Rufus inſerted himſelfe, a gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome addicted to the ſtudy of philoſophy after the way of the Stoicks, who thruſting himſelfe among the companies of the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers began to diſcourſe of the good of peace, &amp; danger of warre, &amp; to ſchoole men in armes: at which many ſcoffed, more grew weary of it, &amp; ſome forbare not to puſh &amp; ſpurne him away, til in the end by the aduiſe of the diſcreeter ſort, and the threats of the other, he was perſuaded to deſiſt from his vnſeaſonable wiſedome. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall virgins alſo were ſent with letters from Vitellius to Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, requeſting him to differre the battaile for one day: by means of that little delay with more eaſe would all points be agreed vpon. The virgins were ſent home with honour, &amp; anſwere was made to Vitellius that by the murder of Sabinus, &amp; the burning of the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol al parle of peace was cut off, and al extremity to be looked for:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18156:89"/> notwithſtanding Antonius calling his army together aſſaied to pacifie them thus farre, that they would bee content to encampe themſelues for that preſent at the Miluian bridge, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the towne before the next day: the reaſon of the motion was, leſt the ſouldier hauing his bloud heated in skirmiſh, ſhould afterwarde ſpare neither people nor Senate, no not the churches and temples of the gods. But they miſliked and ſuſpected all delaie as a hinderance to the victorie: and withall certaine ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners glittering vpon the ſide of the hilles, albeit followed by none but towne-people, and men of no ſeruice, made a ſhew of an armie. Whereupon the Flauianiſts diuiding themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three companies, made their approch to the towne: one part as it ſtoode along the Flaminian waye, another cloſe by the bancke of the Tiber, and the thirde by Via ſalaria towarde the gate called Collina.

They onely of that ſide were diſtreſſed, which turned vpon the lefte hande towarde the Saluſtian gardens, through narrowe lanes and ſlippery waies: where the Vitellianiſts ſtanding aloft vpon the walles of the gardens, with ſtones and iauelins repulſed them, till it was towardes the euening, whenas the horſemen that in the meane time had entred at Collina were at their backs and ſurprized them. In campus Martius alſo there were hoat skirmiſhes betweene them. The Flauianiſts had the fauour of fortune, and the vantage of ſo manie victories: the Vitellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ranne headlong and furious, ſupported with onely deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire: and albeit they were defeated and broken, yet did they rally themſelues againe in the citty. The people ſtoode by and looked on as they fought, and as in a paſtime or game clapped their handes, and encouraged ſometime the one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the other: and when either ſide turned their backes, and hidde themſelues in houſes or ſhoppes, they cried to haue them pluckt out and killed, and ſo attained themſelues the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the pray: for whiles the ſouldiers minded nothing but ſlaughter and bloudſhed, the ſpoile fell to the common
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18156:90"/> peoples ſhare. Ouer all the citty a cruell ſpectacle and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was to be ſeene: in one place fighting and wounding, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tippling and bathing: here ſtreames of bloud, and heapes of dead bodies, and hard by it ſtrumpets and ſtrumpets fellowes: in ſumme all the licentiouſneſſe of a diſſolute and riotous peace, and the miſery of a moſt cruell captiuity: ſo that a man plainelie would iudge one and the ſame towne, both extremely furious and raging, and extremely drowned in pleaſures. There had afore times paſſed great conflicts betweene armed powers in the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, twiſe when Sylla, and once when Cinna ouercame, and the cruelty then was no leſſe: but this was an vnnaturall brutiſh ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that men for one moment of time would not intermit their accuſtomed pleaſures, but as if this had giuen them further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ioy amidſt their feſtiuall daies, clapped handes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced, without care of ſides, at the publicke calamities. But the greateſt difficulty of all was in taking the Praetorian campe, vnto the which the valianteſt amongſt the Vitellian ſouldiers had betaken themſelues, as to their laſt refuge, and therefore the Flauianiſts were the more earneſt to aſſalt it, eſpecially the olde Praetorian cohortes, employing all meanes deuiſed for the taking of moſt fortified townes, as the target fence, engins of batterie, mounts, and firebands, crying alowde that that one worke was the accompliſhment and perfection of all the trauels and dangers, which they in ſo many battailes had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that the citty belonged to the Senate and people, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the gods, &amp; both were reſtored to their owners: but the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers honor was in the campe, that was his cuntrey, &amp; his dwelling place, which vnleſſe they could ſtraightwaies recouer, they muſt &amp; would lye al night in their armour. On the other ſide the Vitellian ſoldiers, although inferiour both in number and fortune, diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the courſe of the victory, hindred the peace, polluting the houſes and altars with bloud, and embracing the laſt comforts to conquered perſons. Many lay gaſping and died vpon the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and battlements of the walles. When the gates were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, they that remained aliue preſented themſelues to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and died al with their face toward the enemy, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon their forepartes: ſuch care they had, ſeeing they muſt dye, to dye in moſt honourable maner. Vitellius whenas the citty was taken, conueyed himſelfe in a carying<note n="*" place="margin">Sellula. Suet. Vitell. c. <hi>16.</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatoria ſella.</note> chaire, by

Anone changing his minde, and as it falles out to men in a maze, fearing all things, and moſt diſliking the preſent, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Palace againe now vaſt and deſolate, euen his baſeſt ſeruantes beeing either fled awaie, or els purpoſelie ſhunning his preſence.

Being led in this manner, one of the German ſouldiers aymed a blowe, whether intending to ſtrike at Vitellius vppon ſome quarrell, or becauſe hee would ſooner rid him from ſhame, or els at the Tribune it is vncertaine, certaine it is that in ſtriking hee cut off the Tribunes eare, and was forthwith ſlaine himſelfe.

Heluidius Priſcus was borne in the firſt region of Italy, in the free city <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Tarracina: his fathers name was Cluuius a principal Centurion. Being very young he applied his rare &amp; excellent wit to thoſe profound ſtudies, not, as the moſt part, to cloke ſlouth, &amp; idleneſſe with ſo glorious a name, but that he might proceede to manage publicke affaires, being firſt by that meanes better armed againſt all miſchances of fortune. In the ſtudy of philoſophie he followed the learning of thoſe<note n="c" place="margin">The Stoicks, out of whoſe ſchoole theſe opinions had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Laert: Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Paradoxis,</hi> &amp; others.</note> maſters, which define that onely to be good which is honeſt; that only ill which is diſhoneſt: other qualities not inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the mind, as powerablenes, nobility &amp; ſuch like, neither good nor euil. When he had only bene Queſtor, Paetus Thraſea made choiſe of him for his ſonne in lawe.

                     </note> driuen into baniſhment, &amp; returning vnder Galba he called Eprius Marcellus, who had informed againſt Thraſea, to his anſwere. This attempt, of ſo great, &amp; ſo iuſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, notwithſtanding diuided the Senate into parts: for if Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus were ouerthrowen, then whole troupes of others, which were in the ſame caſe, muſt needes go to wracke. At the firſt the contention was hoat &amp; fierce, and maintayned of both ſides with notable orations: but when Priſcus perceyued that Galba was doubtfull in the point, at the intreaty of many Senatours, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from following the ſuite; diuerſe men, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall diſpoſitions, diuerſely interpreting his fact, ſome commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his moderation, others miſliking his vnconſtancie. But that ſame aſſembly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Senate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed the Empire to Veſpaſian, withall an embaſſage was agreed vpon, to bee ſent to the Prince. Hereupon aroſe taunting, and bitter wordes betweene Heluidius &amp; Marcellus. Heluidius opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, that the embaſſadors ſhould be elected, and named by the magiſtrates beeing firſt ſworne to chuſe of the fitteſt: Marcellus required they might be choſen by lot, to which purpoſe alſo the deſigned Conſull had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but the principal cauſe, which pricked Marcellus ſo forward that way, was the ſhame which might redounde to himſelfe, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, leſt others being choſen, he ſhould ſeeme to be, as vnworthy reiected. And ſo, after ſome fewe brawling wordes interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably vſed, by litle and litle they fell to continuall, and bitter orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Heluidius demaunding, what cauſed Marcellus ſo much to feare the iudgement of the magiſtrates, ſeeing he excelled many other, both in eloquence, and wealth, things which might eaſily moue them to that choice: vnleſſe peraduenture the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of his own manifolde miſdeedes draue him to diſtruſt them. that the lot made no difference betweene the good and the bad, but ſuffrages and the iudgement of the Senate were deuiſed to enter into euery mans fame, and behauiour. that it greatly appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both to the commodity of the common wealth, and to Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians honor, that thoſe of the Senate ſhould be ſent to meete him, which were beſt accounted of for innocencie, &amp; integrity of life, who might ſeaſon (as it were) the Emperours eares, with good &amp; vertuous ſpeeches. that Thraſea, Soranus, &amp; Seutius had bene of Veſpaſians olde frendes, &amp; acquaintance, whoſe accuſers if they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18156:94"/> muſt not be puniſhed, much leſſe ſent and ſhewed in places of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: &amp; that by this choiſe of the Senate, the Prince ſhould, as it were be admoniſhed whom to like, &amp; whom to eſchew. For no greater inſtruments, or helpes of good regiment can there bee, then good frendes. that Marcellus had done for his part ſufficiently, hauing induced Nero to the deſtruction of ſo many innocents: let him enioy his rewards &amp; impunity, &amp; leaue Veſpaſian to better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors. Marcellus replied, that not his opinion, but the opinion of the deſigned Conſull was impugned, &amp; the ancient precedents, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the choiſe of embaſſadours to lot, to take away al occaſion of ſuiting &amp; debate: that there was no new cauſe, that he knew, why ſo olde a cuſtome ſhould now be aboliſhed, or why this honor done to the Prince ſhould be turned into a diſhonor to any conſidering that euery man was ſufficiently able to cary that meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, &amp; do a low reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to him in the name of the Senate: nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were to beware, leſt through the peruerſnes of ſome the Princes mind might be offended, being now at his entry full of ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſies, &amp; marcking not only words, but alſo al geſtures and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances. that, for his part, he well knew the quality of the times wherein he was borne, &amp; what forme of gouernment our fathers, &amp; grandfathers had eſtabliſhed:<note n="a" place="margin">That is, the time of the free ſtate.</note> beyond he honored &amp; admired, but profeſſed to follow the preſent eſtate that he praied &amp; wiſhed indeed for good Princes: but if it were otherwiſe, would tolerate ſuch as they were. As for the ouerthrow of Thraſea, why ſhould he giue account of accuſing, whenas the Senate gaue none of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning? not his orations, but their voices wrought his vndoing: but ſo was Neroes maner, with ſuch ſhewes to coulour his cruell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; whoſe fauour &amp; frendſhip anguiſhed his mind peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture as much, as baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did ſome other mens. Finally, that wel might Heluidius in conſtancy, &amp; courage be equall to Cato and Brutus: for his owne parte, he was one of that Senate, which were but ſeruants, as well as himſelfe, &amp; would likewiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> counſell Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidius, not to ſeeke to climbe aboue the Prince himſelfe, nor like a tutour to bridle with his precepts Veſpaſian<note n="*" place="margin">

For as wicked Princes loue to rule, &amp; raigne without limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo euen the beſt would haue their ſubiects vſe a meane in their liberty. Theſe things, argued thus to and fro with great heate, diſtracted the Senate into diuerſe opinions; notwithſtanding that parte pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayled,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18156:94"/> which allowed of lot, not only the worſt, but the middle ſort ſtriuing to retaine their ancient cuſtome; yea and the greateſt inclined that way, for feare of diſpleaſure, and enuy, if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſhould be choſen. After this there followed another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The Pretors of the common treaſure (for at that time the common treaſure was gouerned by Pretors) complaining of the emptineſſe of their bagges, preſented requeſt, that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint might be made, to abridge the publicke expenſes. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, both for the greatneſſe of the charge, and difficulty of the remedy, the Conſull deſigned thought good to reſerue to the Prince: but Heluidius would haue it decided in Senate. And as the Conſuls proceeded in asking of voices, Vulcatius Tertullinus Tribune of the people<note n="“" place="margin">Or, interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> interceded, forbidding that any thing of ſo great moment ſhould be determined of, the Prince being abſent. Heluidius alſo, declaring his mind in the Senate, was of opinion, that the Capitol ſhould be builded againe, at the charges, &amp; in the name of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwelth, &amp; Veſpaſian ſhould help. Which ſpeech of his the modeſteſt ſort paſſed ouer the with ſilence, &amp; afterward forgat; howbeit ſome there were that remembred it well. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius Rufus commenced an action againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Publius Celer, by whoſe falſe witnes, he affirmed, that Barea Soranus was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned.

Thus Ciuilis being reſolued to breake, and yet concealing his purpoſe, as meaning to gouerne himſelfe in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18156:96"/> action by the euent, beganne after this maner to worke innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At the commandement of Vitellius, the able men of the Bataui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were ſummoned to be preſſed to the warre: which being of it ſelfe a burdenſome thing, was made much more inſupportable, by the auarice and lewd diſpoſition of the officers, who billed chiefly ſuch as were old or impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſons, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for money releaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: againe ſuch as were vnder age, &amp; faire (as many of their youths are of a comly tal ſtature) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they caried away to abuſe their bodies. At theſe dealings the cuntrey being highly offended, certaine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious heads were ſuborned, to perſuade them to refuſe to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Whereupon Ciuilis aſſembling into a ſacred wood vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a banquet the nobility of the nation, and the chiefe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munalty, when he ſaw them, at far in the night, merry, &amp; warmed with wine, he beginneth a ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne oration: recounting firſt the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; glorious acts of the nation, &amp; then diſcourſeth vnto them of the iniuries, inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, &amp; other miſeries whereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to they are ſubiect, that are ſubiect vnto a ſtrange nation: for that now they were not with the Romans in ſtate of frendes and allies, as in former times, but flat ſeruants and ſlaues; and that not vnder a Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which were more tolerable, albeit they come with a chargeable traine, and a proud and diſdainful kinde of commanding: but they were deliuered into the handes of petty captaines, &amp; Centurions, whom when they had filled with ſpoiles and bloud, then were they remoued, and ſtraight waies freſh hungry maſters ſet ouer them, and new deuiſes of polling inuented. that now the day of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter approched, when children ſhould bee drawen from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, brethren from brethren, neuer to ſee one another againe: &amp; that, which might the rather encourage them, the Romans were neuer in ſo poore a caſe, hauing nothing in their ſtanding campes, but a rich ſpoile, and olde men to garde it: wherefore they ſhould onely lift vp their eies, and not be afraide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> at the naked and bare names of Legions. that they had ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of their own, both of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and horſe, the Germans were allied vnto them in bloud, the French likewiſe affected: that euen the Romans themſelues would not greatly miſlike of this warre, the loſſes whereof, if any were, they might impute to Veſpaſian, and if they went through and conquered, they ſhould not be called to their account. Hauing ended his ſpeech with great approbation of the audience, hee bound them with barbarous ceremonies and adiurations vſed by

Ciuilis, ſuppoſing it ſureſt to woorke by fraude and deceyte, blamed the captaines, for that they had forſaken their caſtels: aſſuring that hee alone, with the cohorte vnder his charge, woulde eaſilie repreſſe the tumult of the Caninefates: &amp; therefore willed them to returne euery man to his owne place. It was perceiued, that his counſaile proceeded not of good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but tended only to this ende, that the cohorts being ſeuered
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18156:97"/> might be ouerthrowen with greater facility: and by many appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent arguments, &amp; ſpeeches of the Germans themſelues, a nation ioyful of warre, &amp; not concealing long their owne ioy, it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered daily more &amp; more, that Ciuilis, not Brinio, was the head &amp; contriuer of this Conſpiracy. Wherefore, ſeeing his ſecret plots tooke none effect, he fell to plaine force, and caſt his power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Caninefates, Friſians, and Batauians into three pointed battels, ech nation by themſelues. The Romans oppoſed their forces againſt him, not farre from the riuer of Rhene, directing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their ſhips, which after the burning of the caſtels, they brought to that place, againſt the enemy. After a little skirmiſhing, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort of the Tungrians fled to Ciuilis: whereupon our ſoldiers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted with the ſodaine treaſon, were on al ſides beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, both by their falſe fellowes, and enemies: the like perfidiouſneſſe was alſo on the water. A great part of the rowers (being Batauians borne) faining vnskil in handling their oare, hindred both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, and ſouldiers in doing their duety: anone without diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation they wrought directly againſt them, and forced the ſhips to the enemy ſide, killing the Maſters and Centurions, that would not condeſcend to their treaſon. And ſo the whole fleete, of foure and twenty barks, either fled to the enemy, or was taken by force. This victory both preſently wanne great reputation, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſtoode in great ſteade: for they got both armour and ſhips, which before they wanted; and throughout France, and Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, they were highly renowned as the authors of liberty. The Germans by and by ſent Embaſſadours offering them aide: and Ciuilis, by pollicy and giftes, endeuoured to winne the hartes of the French, ſending the captaines, whom hee had taken, gently home, and giuing the cohortes free choice, either to abide with him, or at their pleaſure to returne to their cuntrey: if they would tarry, he offred them honourable reward for their ſeruice; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, at their departure he beſtowed vpon them the ſpoiles of the Romans, withall admoniſhing them in ſecrete of their calamities ſuſtained ſo many yeares, and of their miſerable thraldome falſely entitled a peace; ſhewing them how the Batauians, though not charged with tributes, as they, had notwithſtanding taken armes againſt them, which tirannized ouer them both. that the Romans, at the firſt encounter, were put to the flight by them, and diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: what were then to be hoped, if all France ſhould ioine to ſhake
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18156:97"/> of the yoke? Italie was diſarmed, and could of it ſelfe, neither conquere nor keepe; but with the prouinces bloud were the prouinces wonne. that they ſhould not be diſcouraged with the remembrance of Vindex misfortune: for the Batauian horſe were the men, which defeated him and his armie; and among the Aydes of Verginius there were beſide ſome French out of Belgica, and in true account France was ruined by her owne forces. But now if it pleaſed them to ioine with him in this action, they both ſhould make but one party: beſide that they had ſeene and learned the beſt of the Romans militare diſcipline: moreouer thoſe old expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Batauian cohorts, before whom Othoes Legions could not ſtande, no doubt would goe with him. let Syria, and Aſia, &amp; the Eaſt, vſed to ſerue kings, be ſlaues if they liſt; in France many men were yet aliue borne before tributes<note n="a" place="margin">And Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes began a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue ſix ſcore yeares before. ſo that many in Fraunce be like were long liued.</note> beganne: neither could it be denyed, that Germanie of late, by the ouerthrowe and death of Quintilius Varus, had giuen a checke to the Romiſh vſurpers, baniſhed ſeruitude, and prouoked to the field, not a Vitellius, but a Caeſar Auguſtus. that liberty was granted by nature to dumbe beaſts alſo, but vertue and valure were peculiare ornaments of mankinde, and to the valiant alone the gods gaue their aſſiſtance. Wherefore, ſince they were at good leyſure, and freſh, he willed them to ſet couragiouſly vpon their buſily occupied and tired e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: whiles ſome leaned to Veſpaſian, ſome claue to Vitellius, vndoubtedly harme might be wrought againſt both.

Moreouer the great compaſſe of the trench made the attempt of the beſiegers more feaſable and increaſed their hope. For whereas it was made to containe two Legions, at that preſent it had ſcarſe fiue thouſand armed men to defende it, beſide the followers of the campe, which vppon the breaking vp of the peace gathered thither, and there remayned doing them ſome ſeruice in the warre. A parte of the campe was ſituate vppon the pendant of an eaſie hill, and parte ſtoode vpon the plaine ground. That ſtanding campe Auguſtus ſettled there, ſuppoſing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18156:100"/> it ſufficient to watch ouer, and as it were, to beſiege the cuntreyes of Germanie, neuer imagining that the world could goe ſo farre otherwiſe, as that they ſhould preſume to beginne and aſſaile our Legions: whereupon the leſſe coſt was beſtowed, either to help the ſite of the place, or the ſtrength of the bulwarks: men and armour alone were thought a ſufficient defence. Now to the ende, that being ſeuered in place, the proweſſe of ech nation might more diſtinctly appeare, and be ſeene, the Batauians, and the Germans which dwelt beyonde the Rhene, tooke ſtanding ech by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and began to dart at our men a farre of.

                  <p>IN <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> the meane time Flaccus, hauing vnderſtoode of the ſiege of Vetera, and ſent into France to leuy Aides, ſelected out of his Legions a company of choſen men, and committed them to the leading of Dillius Vocula, Lieutenant of the eighteenth Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, willing him to haſten, and make all poſsible ſpeede along the bancke of the riuer; himſelfe followed ſlowly, and drooping for feare, being mortally hated of his ſouldiers. For they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged him, that hee had ſuffred wilfully to ſcape from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gontiacum the cohortes of the Batauians, or rather purpoſelie ſent them away: that Ciuilis rebellious attempts were by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuence foſtered, and by his meanes the Germans called to the party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that neither Antonius Primus, nor Mutianus, had ſo ſtrengthened Veſpaſians ſide, as Flaccus by this kinde of diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling dealing: for open enemies and armes might openly and with armes be repelled, but fraude and deceite were matters hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, &amp; therefore could not be auoided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Ciuilis ſtoode in the fielde embattelled againſt them, but Hordeonius out of his bed chamber gaue order, and directed as was moſt for the enemies behoofe: and why then ſhould ſo many armed companies of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſouldiers bee gouerned by a ſicke and ſeely olde man? nay why ſhould they not rather diſpatch ſuch a traitour, and free their fortune and vertue from the ill chance of ſo vnlucky a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? As they were in theſe ſpeeches one with another, letters came from Veſpaſian which incenſed them more, the which Flaccus, becauſe hee could not conceale, cauſed openly to bee red before the aſſembly, and ſent the bringers thereof bounde to Vitellius. By this meanes the ſouldiers mindes were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what appeaſed: and ſo they came to Bonna the ſtanding campe of the firſt Legion: the ſouldiers whereof were more diſpleaſed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18156:101"/> with Flaccus then the other: laying the fault of their late ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe wholly vpon him: auerring that they at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment marched forth againſt the Batauians, aſſuring themſelues, vpon his promiſe, that his Legions from Magontiacum ſhould aſſayle them behinde; and ſo no ſupply comming from thence, they loſt their liues through his treaſon: that theſe matters had neuer beene notified to the reſt of the armies, nor to the Prince, or els by the helpe and aſsiſtance of ſo many cuntreies this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine rebellion might haue beene quenched in the beginning. Whereupon Hordeonius cauſed the coppies of all the letters, which he had ſent into France, Britannie and Spaine, requeſting their helpe, to be red to the army, and beganne a very ill example, that all letters ſent from abroade ſhould be deliuered to the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd-bearers of the Legions, who red them to the ſouldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to the Generals hande. Then he commanded one of the moſt factious to be apprehended and bound, rather to put his right in vre, then becauſe the fault was but of one man alone: and ſo he<note n="a" place="margin">Taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him the firſt Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a great part thereof, as it doeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. p. 172. &amp;c.</note> remoued with his army from Bonna to Coleyn, where many Aydes reſorted vnto him of the French nation, which at the firſt with all their power aſsiſted the Romans, till afterwards ſeeing the Germans preuaile, many of them tooke armes againſt vs in hope of freedome, and that point attained, for deſire of ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty. But the wrath of the Legions ſtil increaſed, neither could one ſouldiers impriſonment terrifie them: nay euen the party im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonned impeached the Generall of treaſon; alleadging that he had beene meſſenger betweene Ciuilis and him, and therefore a colour was ſought to make him away, leſt he ſhould declare, and teſtifie the trueth. Then Vocula, with maruelous ſtoutneſſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into the Tribunal, commanded the ſouldier, as he excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and cried, to be apprehended, and caried away to execution: which thing ſo terrified the bad and ſeditious, that the ſounder ſort without impeachment fulfilled his commaundement, and anone by common conſent they demanded Vocula to bee their Generall: which place Flaccus willingly reſigned vnto him. But their minds were already mutinouſly affected, and many new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of more rage were preſented; as want of pay, &amp; prouiſion of corne;<note n="b" place="margin">

Among the ignorant and ſimpler ſort the lowneſſe of the water was held for a prodigious matter, as if the riuers alſo, and the ancient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of the Empire had now forſaken vs, &amp; that which in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able times would haue beene counted chance, or proceeding of naturall cauſes, at that time was called a fatall matter, and gods indignation and wrath. At Noueſium they aſſumed the ſixteenth Legion; and Herennius Gallus Lieutenant of the firſt Legion was ioyned with Vocula in part of the charge: yet durſt they not goe to finde the enemy, but encamped themſelues at a place called Gelduba. There they trained, and practiſed their ſoldiers in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of battels, in fortifyng, entrenching, and other militare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. And to the ende that they might by booties and ſpoiles take courage and hart, Vocula led forth part of his army into the cuntrey of the Gugerni adioyning, who had allyed themſelues with Ciuilis: part remained behinde with Herennius Gallus. And as by chance, not farre from the campe, a barge loaden with corn, was runne vpon a ſhelfe, the Germans eſpying it laboured to draw it to their ſide of the water; which Gallus would not endure, but ſent a cohort to the reskew: the Germans alſo increaſed their number, and ſo by little and little, ſupply reſorting on both ſides, a battaile was fought: wherein the Germans, after the ſlaughter of many of our men, by force haled the boate away. Our ſouldiers, being thus put to the worſe, according to their cuſtome there, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not their owne cowardlineſſe, but the treaſon of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whom they drew out of his tent, tare his clothes, and bet his body, commanding him to tell vpon what price, and with what complices he had thus betrayed the army. But<note n="a" place="margin">Who, as it ſeemes, ſtayed behind at <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſium.</hi>
                     </note> Hordeonius was charged with the whole enuy of the fact; him they termed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuer of the miſchiefe, Gallus onely the inſtrument; till at length Gallus, being terrified with their threatning of his deſtruction, to ſaue his owne life, was content to charge Hordeonius alſo with treaſon.

In the way they tooke vp and ſpoiled the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding campe of a wing ſited at Aſciburg, and ſo ſodainely aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the enemies campe at Gelduba, that Vocula had no leyſure to ſpeake to the ſouldiers, or to diſplay the ranckes: thus much one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in a tumult, hee warned to ſtrengthen the middle battell with Legionarie ſouldiers, and the Auxiliaries to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues about on euery ſide.

                  <p>CIVILIS in the meane time had aſſayed to induce the Legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to ſurrendre, as though the Romans had beene quite ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, &amp; his men obtained an entier victory. for prooffe whereof he commanded the Roman enſeignes, and banners to be caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the priſoners produced in ſight, whereof one ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red worthely, and declared alowde how the whole matter had paſſed, &amp; was killed in the place by the Germans, which thing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them within to beleeue his relation the better, and withall by the waſting &amp; burning of the villages they might diſcerne, that their owne victorious army was comming. When Vocula came neare vnto Vetera he commanded the enſeigns to be pitched in the ſight of the campe, and a ditch and trenche to be caſt round about: that laying aſide their baggage and needeleſſe furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in place of ſafetie, they might fight more lightlie and leſſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18156:103"/> encombred. Whereupon the ſouldiers beganne to exclame, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to goe to the battaile, and now they were growen to that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to threaten their Leader. So without taking ſo much time as onely to ſet the battell in array, diſordred, and tired, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne the fight; for Ciuilis was ready to preſent them the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, repoſing no leſſe affyance in the follies and faults of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, then in the vertue and valure of his owne people. Of the Roman ſide the matter went doubtfull and hard, and the moſt mutinous prooued the moſt daſtards: ſome there were which mindefull of the victorie lately obteined kept their ſtanding, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the enemie, and animated themſelues and their fellowes. The battaile being thus brought backe againe, which erewhile in a maner was loſt, they held vp their handes to them in the campe, that they ſhould not neglect to vſe the opportunity, who behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all things from the walles, iſſued forth at all the gates, and by chance Ciuilis being by the fall of his horſe ouerthrowen, of both ſides was thought to be wounded or ſlaine; which greatly diſmayed his men and cauſed them to breake, and contrarilie put courage in ours. But Vocula purſued not the chace, but entring Vetera onely augmented the rampiers, and towers of the campe, as againſt a newe ſiege, being had in a ieloſie, by this kinde of colde dealing, to deſire the continuance of the warre: and not without cauſe, hauing ſo often marred the victorie for want of good following.</p>

The cohorts proceeded forward to Gelduba, the campe ſtanding there as it was, garded by the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which Vocula had left. There was no queſtion what perill there would be in the returne, the forragers being but fewe, and heauily loaden: whereupon Vocula determining to goe out and relieue them, increaſed his armie with a thouſand men choſen out of the two Legions, which were beſieged at Vetera, the firſt and fifteenth, a ſtubborne and hedſtrong ſouldier, and hating his captaines. More went then were commanded, at their going o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly murmuring, that they would no longer endure famine, nor be obnoxious to the ſecrete practiſes of the Lieutenants: but thoſe which remayned behinde complained, that they, by carying away ſo many men, were forſaken, and left as a pray to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Whereupon a double mutinee grew, the one part recalling Vocula ſeditiouſly, and the other in like ſort refuſing to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the campe. In the meane ſeaſon Ciuilis beſieged Vetera. Vocula marcheth to Gelduba, and leauing Gelduba (which Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ſtraight way tooke vp) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to Noueſium, not farre from whence, ſhortly after, his horſemen skirmiſhed with the enemy proſperouſly. But proſperity &amp; aduerſity inflamed alike the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſeeke their captaines deſtruction: and the Legions being augmented, by that increaſe out of the fift and fifteenth Legion, more inſolently required their donatiue, vnderſtanding that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was ſent from Vitellius. Whereupon Hordeonius, without further delay, diuided the money amongſt them in Veſpaſians name, which was the principall thing that miniſtred matter, &amp; fed the mutinee which followed. For the ſouldiers, hauing idle ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding money, gaue themſelues to ryot and banquetting, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blies by night, and by that meanes renewed their former wrath and diſpleaſure againſt Hordeonius, whom they haled out of his chamber &amp; ſlew, none of the Lieutenants or Tribunes daring to gainſay, or withſtand them being hardened, by reaſon of the night
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18156:104"/> ſeaſon, againſt all modeſtie and ſhame. The like was intended againſt Vocula, if hee had not in a bondmans attire eſcaped vnknowen in the darke. Aſſoone as the heate of their fury was paſt, they fell to conſider the danger wherein they did ſtande, &amp; ſent by and by Centurions with letters to the cities of France, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring ſupply of money and men, themſelues when Ciuilis appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as the common ſort without head is headlong, feareful, and ſluggiſh, raſhly tooke vp their weapons, &amp; ſoone laying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe ranne away.

                  <p>THE day that Domitian, after his newe honour came into the Senate, he made a briefe and curteous ſpeech concerning his fathers, and brothers abſence, and of his owne greene yeares and lacke of experience, with a comely grace and decent behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: his often bluſhing and being out of countenance, his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being not yet knowen abroad, was reputed modeſty &amp; baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. Whenas he propoſed that Galba ſhould be reſtored to his honour and dignity, Curtius Montanus was of opinion, that the memory of Piſo alſo ſhould be ſolemnized, the Senators allowed of both: howbeit concerning Piſo it tooke none effect. After this, certain were alotted to ſee reſtitution made of thoſe things, which had beene by force taken away in the warre; and ſome others to view &amp; ſet vp the braſen tables of the lawes, which by<note n="a" place="margin">By the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Capitoll mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſaieth <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etonius Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiano. c.</hi> 8.</note> tract of time were decaied; &amp; others to reforme &amp; purge the publicke records, and regiſters, which by flattery of times were corrupted, &amp; to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and ſtint the publicke expenſes.

The next meeting Domitian begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to perſwade, that olde griefes and grudges ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, but buried together with the memory of the late times, wherein men were forced to doe many things againſt their owne mindes, Mutianus continuing the ſpeech opined at large in fauour of the accuſers, gently admoniſhing withall, and as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them, who ſeemed to reſume their actions which they had diſcontinued. The Senatours, when they ſawe they were croſſed in following their liberty, medled no further, and Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, leſt the iudgement of the Senate ſhould ſeeme to bee little regarded, and a generall pardon as it were proclaimed of all crimes committed vnder Nero, commanded Octauius Sagitta and Antiſtius Soſianus, Senatours by calling, which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaue returned from exile, to be reduced into the ſame ilands againe.<note n="a" place="margin">Yac. <hi>13.</hi> Ann. p. <hi>470.</hi>

But Mutianus could not with all this wipe the ill opinion away of his former dealing. For Soſianus and Sagitta were men vile and of no account, neither mattered it where they liued: but the accuſers great gifts, great wealth and great power, being men

The Senatours mindes were anone in part reconciled by meanes of a certaine cauſe heard in the houſe, and decided according to ancient cuſtome.

So Mutianus, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the campe to the end he might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter view their yeares of ſeruice, appointed the winners ſeuerally to ſtand, with their enſeignes &amp; weapons, a litle diſtance aſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>det. Then he willed the Vitellian garde, as wel thoſe which yeelded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues at Bouillae, as others ſought out within the Citty and about, to bee produced in a manner vnarmed, then to bee diuided, and thoſe which were choſen out of the German and Brittiſh armies, and ſo of the reſt, if any were, to ſtande ech by themſelues.

But when they beganne to bee drawen, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted hither and thither, they trembled all, eſpecially the German ſouldiers, as if the ſeparation tended onely to ſort them out to the

                  <p>ABOVT the ſame time Lucius Piſo Proconſull of Africke was ſlaine: the trueth of which murther I will briefly ſet downe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming firſt certaine former matters, which may ſeeme to haue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred chiefly occaſion, and cauſe to ſuch like inconueniences. The Legion in Africke, and the Aydes aſsigned to garde the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the Empire that way, in the time of Auguſtus, and Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, were vnder the gouernement of the Proconſull, till Caius a Prince of a troubled braine, and hauing in ielouſie M. Silanus,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18156:108"/> who then was Proconſull of Africke, remooued the Legion from the Proconſull, deliuering it to a Lieutenant ſent for that purpoſe. The parting of an office thus betweene two without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, and their charge and points of commisſion lying intermingled, and running ioyntly together, bred and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as was intended, diſcorde and quarrels: and ſo through ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter emulation the Lieutenants office incroched and grew, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they continued longer in charge, or becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour perſons commonly take more payne, and delight in contending with their ſuperiours, the greateſt men of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſuls ſeeking rather ſafety then might. Now at this time Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Feſtus was Lieutenant of the Legion there, a riotous youngman, and one that gaped after great matters, but much perplexed in minde, by reaſon he was ſo nearely allyed to Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. This Valerius in his often conferences which hee had with Piſo, whether he perſwaded him to take vpon him the ſtate, or oppoſed himſelfe againſt Piſoes ſolliciting it is vncertaine (for at their ſecrete communication none was preſent beſide: and when Piſo was ſlaine moſt men inclined to fauour the ſlayer) certaine it is, that the prouince and ſouldiers were ill affected toward Veſpaſian. And ſome of the Vitellianiſts eſcaping out of the Citty, layed downe before Piſo the great posſibility of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuating that purpoſe: that France was in termes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolting, Germanie readie to ſide themſelues with him, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the danger wherein hee ſtoode for his owne perſon, and that in a ſuſpected peace open warre was the onely ſafe courſe. As theſe things were in doing, Claudius Sagitta captaine of the Petrin wing came thither, hauing out-ſayled Papirius a Centurion ſent by Mutianus, and auowched that the ſayed Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion had commisſion to diſpatch Piſo: that his kinſman and ſonne in lawe Galerianus was already diſpatched in Rome; ſo that the onely hope of ſafety conſiſted in venturing boldly: and of venturing there were but two waies, either ſtraight to take armes, or ſayling into France to offer himſelfe there for a head to the Vitellian armies. Notwithſtanding all which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations Piſo perſiſted vnmooueable: and anone the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſent by Mutianus came; who, aſſoone as he arriued at the porte of Carthage, proclaymed Piſo Emperour, wiſhing to him as Prince all ſucceſſe and proſperity, and requiring all that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18156:109"/> hee met, being amazed at the wonder, to ioyne in the ſame crye. The credulous common people flocked in the market place and demanded the preſence of Piſo, filling the citty with ſhowts &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of ioy, partly vpon negligence to ſearch out the truth, and partly vpon a pleaſure in flatterie. But Piſo, whether vpon the intimation of Sagitta, or of his owne modeſty, refrained from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad &amp; committing himſelfe to the peoples diſcretion: &amp; examining the Centurion, perceiuing it was but a ſnare to entrap him, &amp; ſo to make him away, he commanded him to be ſlaine, not ſo much for hope of eſcaping himſelfe by ſo doing, as vpon iuſt indignation againſt the Centurion, becauſe the ſame man had beene one of the murtherers of Clodius Macer, &amp; ment to bring his hands lately embrued with the bloud of a Lieutenant now to the ſlaughter of a Proconſull. Then he checked the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians with a ſharpe and ſeuere edict, and ceaſed to execute euen the vſuall points of his office, keeping ſtill within dores, leſt any occaſion of new commotion by miſchance might ariſe. Feſtus vnderſtanding how the people was daunted and daſhed, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion ſlaine, and other occurrencies part true, part falſe, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and amplifyed, as fame feedeth in going, ſendeth certaine horſemen to murther Piſo; who making all haſt in the dawning of the day brake into the houſe of the Proconſull with drawen ſwordes, the moſt part not knowing Piſo by ſight, being Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of the cuntrey, and Moores picked out for the purpoſe. Whereupon meeting one of his ſeruants, not farre from his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, they asked him who he was, and where Piſo was to be founde: the ſeruant perceyuing his maſters danger, notably and reſolutely anſwered, that hee was Piſo, and ſo was preſentlie ſlaine in the place: by and by after Piſo himſelfe was maſſacred. For there was in the company Bebius Maſſa, one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatours of Africke, that knew him; euen then a woorker of good mens deſtruction, and one that often will fall into the courſe of this ſtory, as an inſtrument of the miſchieffes, and a cauſe of the miſeries that wee ſuſtayned<note n="a" place="margin">

As concerning the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the Capitoll againe, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> committed the charge thereof to Lucius Veſtinus a Gentleman of Rome, but for autority and countenance one of the principall men of the citty; by whom the ſoothſayers being called together expreſly charged, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the former te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple ſhould be conueied &amp; caried away into the mariſhes, &amp; the new erected vpon the ſelfe ſame foundation: for it was not the pleaſure of the gods the old forme ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.

For Ciuilis now lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide disſimulation declared himſelfe, and made open warre againſt the Roman Empire. The Legions which had ſerued Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius wiſhed rather forraine bondage, then to haue Veſpaſian their Prince. The Frenchmen conceiued courage, and hope of freeing themſelues from the yoke, ſuppoſing that the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was befallen to our armies in all places alike: and indeede a rumour was noyſed that our ſtanding campes in Pannonia and Moeſia were ſtraitly beſieged by the Sarmatians and Dacians: the like was reported of Britannie. But nothing perſwaded them ſo much to beleeue, that the Roman Empire was come to an ende, as the burning of the Capitoll. For the cittie had beene once before taken by the French, but the ſeate of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter then being vntaken the Empire ſtoode and remayned: whereas nowe by this fatall fire a manifeſt ſigne of the gods heauy wrath, and diſpleaſure was giuen. And the Druides out of their vayne ſuperſtitious learning did prophecie that the Empire of the worlde was to paſſe, and bee ſeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde the mountaines.

But before the murther of Hordeonius Flaccus nothing brake out whereby the conſpiracy might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued: after his death there paſſed meſſages, betweene Ciuilis and Clasſicus captaine of the wing of the Treueri. Clasſicus in birth and wealth farre exceeded the reſt of that quarter. he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the line of their ancient kings, his aunceſtours renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in warre and in peace, and himſelfe boaſted to be deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of enemies to the people of Rome, rather then frendes. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in this action adioyned themſelues Iulius Tutor, and Iulius Sabinus, the one of Triers, the other a Lingon. Tutor was appointed by Vitellius ouerſeer of the bancke of Rhene.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding certaine of the Vbij and Tungri were preſent at the conſultation: but the ſtrongeſt part and that which caryed the matter was of the Treueri and Lingones.

This was no ſooner ſayed then allowed: a ſcruple remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned concerning the remnant of the Roman ſoldiers. Many were of minde that they were to be put to the ſworde, as mutinous, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18156:111"/> faithleſſe perſons, and polluted with the bloud of their leaders: but the opinion of ſparing them preuailed, leſt hope of pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away they would become deſperate. So it was thought more conuenient by faire meanes to allure them to the party, &amp; that the Lieutenants alone being made away, the common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would eaſily be wunne to the ſide vpon guiltineſſe of their owne miſdeeds, and hope of impunity. This was the forme of their firſt conſultation, and ſome were ſent abroad into France to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ſtirre vp the warre: they themſelues pretended all ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience to Vocula, that they might oppreſſe him at the more vnawares.

So betweene vnſure ſouldiers, and ſecret enemies, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it the beſt way that now he could take to vſe their owne artes againſt them, he diſſembled the matter &amp; went downe to Coleyn. Thither Claudius Labeo was eſcaped, hauing corrupted his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; who as before we haue ſaide was taken, and confined out of the way into Friſia, and promiſing that if hee might haue men hee would goe into Batauia, and reunite the greateſt part of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey againe to the Roman Empire: hauing a prety company of horſemen &amp; footemen aſsigned, he durſt not enterpriſe any thing amongſt the Batauians, but drew certaine of the Neruij and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaſij after him into the fielde, and rather by ſtealth, then by way of open inuaſion, made ſome incurſions vpon the Caninefates and Marſaci.</p>

Mummius Lupercus the Lieutenant of a Legion among other preſents was ſent to Velleda, a virgin of the Bructerian nation, and queene ouer many cuntreyes: for ſo the olde maner of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans is, to beleeue many of their women to be propheteſſes, and ſo, ſuperſtition increaſing, goddeſſes.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18156:114"/> and the Roman Legions ſhould be deſtroied. But Lupercus was ſlaine in the way: a few Centurions and Tribunes French borne were reſerued as a pledge of alliance and amity. The ſtanding campes of the cohortes, wings and Legions, were ouerthrowen and burned, thoſe onely excepted which were at Magontiacum and Vindoniſſa. The ſixteenth Legion with the Auxiliaries, which at the ſame time yeelded themſelues, was commanded to departe from Noueſium to Triers, and a day ſet downe, before which they ſhould auoide the campe. The meane time was ſpent in ſundrie cares. Some of the cowardelieſt were terrified with the late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of them which were ſlaine at Vetera, in their iſſuing out; the better ſort bluſhed for ſhame, to thinke of the infamous and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable iourney, whom they muſt follow for guides, and how al things ſhould bee at the ſimple pleaſure and diſcretion of thoſe, whom they had made lords ouer their life and death: others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of diſhonour packed about them money and ſuch things as were of moſt price: others made ready their harneſſe &amp; buckled themſelues to their weapons as though they were going to fielde.

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour Claudius Sanctus augmented the indignitie, one eied, ill fauoured in countenance, and weaker in wit. The diſhonour was doubled, when as the firſt Legion relinquiſhing their campe at Bonna, vpon the like commandement adioined themſelues to the other: and the cuntreymen, that a little before quaked for feare at the very name of a Roman, when the fame of the Legions capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity was noiſed, ranne out of their houſes, and fields from al quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to gaze and feede their eies with ſo ſtrange a ſight.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18156:118"/> purpoſing, ſo ſoone as he could ouertake the enemies without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to ioyne iſſue in fielde. A ſupply of ſoldiers ſent out of Fraunce he turned home againe, willing them to ſignifie ſo much to the reſt in his name, that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Legions ſuffized for the defence of the Roman Empire: &amp; that al our good frends &amp; allies ſhould returne to their peaceable buſineſſe, without further care, aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that the warre, now that the Romans perſonally vndertooke it, was as good as already diſpatched. That increaſed the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the French: for hauing receiued their men backe againe, they ſupported more eaſily al taxes &amp; tributes, and were the more ready to perfourme all pointes of their duety, becauſe they ſawe their helpe was not needed. But Ciuilis and Claſsicus, whenas they heard of the ouerthrowe of Tutor, the ſlaughter of the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueri, and the good ſucceſſe euery where of their enemies, all in a fright and haſt ſeeke to vnite their diſperſed powers, ſending meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers in the meane time to Valentinus one after another, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him to take heede to the maine chance, &amp; not raſhly to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; hazard the battel. With ſo much the more expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis diſpatched to the Mediomatrici, lying nearer vpon the enemy, certaine to leade the two Legions thence to aſſaile them on that ſide: &amp; aſſembling all the ſoldiers at Magontiacum, and the power which he had brought with him ouer the mountaines, himſelfe mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched forwarde, and at the thirde remooue came to Rigodulum, a place naturally ſtrong by reaſon of the high ſituation, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Moſella cloſing it in: where Valentinus with a great power of Treueri was encamped, and had made it ſtronger by arte, caſting trenches and ditches about it, and mighty huge ſtones to hinder the paſſage. But theſe fortifications terrified the Roman captaine nothing at all, but boldly hee bad the footemen breake thorow, and appointed his battell of horſemen to clime vp the mountaine, deſpiſing the enemy, whom he knew to be rawe, and vnskilfull in ſeruice, and not to haue that aduantage by the difference of place, that himſelfe had by the difference of men. At the going vp of the hill ſome litle ſtay was made, vntill the enemies had ſpent their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and dartes: then comming to handy ſtroakes, they were driuen downe headlong, &amp; tumbled one ouer another, as it were ſtones at the fall of a building: &amp; part of the horſemen fetching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by eaſier aſcents tooke many of the chiefe nobility of Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um priſoners, and amongſt others Valentinus Generall that day
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18156:118"/> of the fielde. the next day Cerealis entred the towne of Triers. The ſouldiers were extremely deſirous to raze the citty, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that here Claſsicus, here Tutor was borne: here were the men through whoſe wicked conſpiracy the Legions were beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ſlaine. what had poore Cremona deſerued ſo greatly, as to be rooted out of the body of Italie, becauſe it differred the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory onely one night? here in the confines of Germanie ſtoode the ſeatetowne of rebellion entier, &amp; triumphing with the ſpoiles, and ſlaughter of our armies and Generals. As for the ſpoile he might at his pleaſure diſpoſe of to the Princes behoofe, they could be contented with the burning, and ruines of that rebellious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, to requite thereby in ſome part the deſtruction of ſo many campes. Cerealis for feare of infamy, if he ſhould be thought to nooſell his ſouldiers in licentiouſneſſe and cruelty, repreſſed their anger, and they obeyed, being become now they had left off ciuill warre, of more modeſt behauiour alſo in forreine. Then the miſerable &amp; pitifull ſpectacle of the Legions, which came from the Mediomatrici, drew mens minds to the conſideration thereof. V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the guilt of their offence they ſtoode with a ſad and ſorrowful countenance, caſting their eies downe to the ground, no ioyfull greeting when the armies met, nor anſwering ought to thoſe that ſought to encourage and comfort them, but hiding themſelues in their tents, not abiding to looke on the light: not ſo much amazed with danger or feare, as with the ſhame and diſcredit. and euen the conquerous were aſtoniſhed at the ſight, who not daring to ſpeake, begged their pardon with ſilence and teares, till ſuch time as Cerealis with comfortable wordes reuiued their ſpirits; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that thoſe things, which indeede came to paſſe through the mutinouſneſſe of the ſouldiers, or the diſſenſion of the leaders, or the malice of the enemies, were but fatall miſchances, which could not be eſcaped: and therefore that day they ſhould account the firſt both of their ſeruice, and oath: their former facts neyther the Prince, nor he would remember. Then were they receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame campe, and a proclamation made throughout all the bandes, that no man in contention or anger ſhould obiect to any of them their miſdeedes or miſhappes. Then calling the Treueri and Lingones to an aſſembly, hee ſpake vnto them in this wiſe.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18156:120"/> The Roman army caſt a ditch and trench about their campe, in the which they were before vnaduiſedly lodged without any defence. Among the captaines of the other ſide there was diuerſity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the matter debated both waies. Ciuilis thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſtay for the Germans comming which dwelt ouer the Rhene, the terrour of which nations would treade vnderfoote the Roman powers: as for the Frenchmen it mattered not much what way they went, being nought els but a pray to the conquerours; and yet the ſtrength of France, the Belgians, had either openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for them, or at leaſt ſecretly wiſhed them well. Contrarily Tutor affirmed, that by delay the Romans would growe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo many whole hoſtes comming in from euery ſide, one Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being already tranſported out of Britannie, others ſent for out of Spaine, and many Legions at hande out of Italie, not of raw ſouldiers, but olde and well expert in warre: as for the Germans they looked for, what were they els but a kinde of vnprofitable troubles of a campe, out of all awe and obedience to ſuperiours, that would not be commanded nor ruled, but doe all as they liſted themſelues? Now for money and gifts, the onely meanes to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Germans, the Romans had more abundancee, and no man was ſo haſty to fight, but would rather chuſe quietneſſe then danger with the ſame hire. Whereas if they would preſently fight, Cerealis had no other Legions as yet, but onely the remnants of the German army enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled with an oath to the Empire of France. And moreouer this their late vnlooked for ſucceſſe againſt Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, and his rude vntrained company, would be a bait vnto them and their General to further raſhneſſe, and therefore they would without doubt venture againe, and ſo fall into the handes not of an vnskilful youth, better ſeene in words and babble, then armes and militare feates, but of Ciuilis and Claſsicus; at the very ſight of whom the enemies would tremble, calling to remembrance their former feares, and flightes, and famines, and how oft they had beene taken and pardoned their liues. Neither doe the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueri and Lingones keepe in with the Romans now vpon loue and goodwill, but for feare: which take ye away and they will reſume their weapons againe. Claſsicus approuing rhe opinion of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor decided the controuerſie, and forthwith they proceede to execution. The middle battell was aſsigned to the Vbij and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones, on the right ſide ſtoode the Batauian cohorts, on the lefte

In which confuſion Cerealis behauing himſelfe without all feare, with his owne handes drew backe them which fled away, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, albeit vnarmed among ſo many weapons, with his fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate raſhneſſe, and the asſiſtance of ſome valiant ſouldiers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, recouered the bridge, and left a choſen company of men to garde it. Then returning to the campe he found the bandes of the Legions, which were taken at Bonna and Noueſium, disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſcattered, fewe ſouldiers at their enſeignes, and the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derds almoſt circumuented. <q rend="margQuotes">"Whereupon being full of indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wrath, You forſake not (quoth he) Hordeonius or Vocula, you can alleadge no falſehood or treaſon in me: neyther euer did I commit any act that needed excuſe, ſaue onely in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming you had forgotten your oath to France, and remembred your allegeance to the Roman Empire.

Tutor and Clasſicus and Ciuilis ech in their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall quarters animated their men to fight, the Frenchmen for libertie, the Batauians for glory, and the Germans for ſpoile: and all went with the enemie, till the one and twentieth Legion knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O report and deliuer to poſterity the doings and demeanours of excellent perſonages, a thing vſuall in ancient times, euen our age, though careleſſe otherwiſe of her owne, hath not omitted then and ſo oft whenas any great &amp; eminent vertue hath ouergrowen two vices, to little and great common wealths common alike,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ignorance of that which is good, and enuying at it. But in the daies of our anceſtours as it was farre more eaſie and open to atchieue acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worthy of writing, ſo likewiſe their fineſt wittes, without fauor or flattery, vpon an vpright conſcience, without other rewarde, were led to record and chronicle the ſame: yea diuerſe vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their owne proceedings haue thought it no preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſet downe in writing themſelues their owne liues. Neither were Rutilius and Scaurus a whit more miſliked, or leſſe beleeued for that: ſo certaine it is, that vertues are then valewed moſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whenas they doe grow in moſt plenty. But now it fareth with me farre otherwiſe: who hauing here to deſcribe the life of a man already deceaſed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> am firſt of force to beg pardon; a thing which indeede I would haue forborne, were I not to meete and fal in with a time ſo terrible, ſo capitall an enemy to vertue and honour. We reade that Arulenus Ruſticus for praiſing Paetus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thraſea, and Herennius Senecio for commending Heluidius Priſcus were both put to death: and beſide the writers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> againſt the bookes alſo ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was vſed, charge being giuen from authority to the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiri, that the workes of thoſe noble wittes ſhould be in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place ſolemnely burned. Be like they ſuppoſed they could with that fire quench the ſpeech of the people of Rome, aboliſh the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Senate, &amp; ſuppreſſe the common knowledge of whole mankinde; expelling withall the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> profeſſours of wiſedome, and baniſhing all good learning and artes, leſt any ſparckle of honeſty ſhould by miſchance remaine within view. For certaine we gaue great proofe of our patience, and as our anceſtours attained and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18156:124"/> ſawe the higheſt pitch and perfection of liberty, ſo we of ſeruility, being depriued by intelligencers and ſpies of the commerce of hearing and ſpeaking togither: yea memory alſo, as well as toung we had loſt, had it lyen in our power aſwell to forget as it did to keepe ſilence. Now at the length our former ſpirits beginne to reuiue: howbeit although Prince Nerua, ſtraight at the firſt entry of this moſt happy age, hath wiſely matched and mixed together two things heretofore inſociable, the ſouerayntie of one with the libertie of all; and Traian his ſonne, proceeding in the ſame traine, maketh the Empire dayly more ſupportable and eaſie; ſo that not onely wee may hope and conceaue prayers for the publicke ſecurity, but ſee and touch the effect of our prayers aſſured and confirmed vnto vs: yet notwithſtanding by proofe it is found (ſuch is the nature of mans imbecillity) the remedies to bee of ſlower operation, then were the diſeaſes. And as our bodies waxe and gather ſtrength by leyſure, periſh in a moment; ſo good wittes and good learning are ſooner cut downe then rayſed againe. For the ſweeteneſſe and pleaſing of idleneſſe, and of doing nothing, creepeth into our ſenſes: and ſlouthfulneſſe which at the firſt wee deteſt, by cuſtome obtayneth our fauour and loue: to omit that in<note n="a" place="margin">For ſo long <hi>Domitian</hi> was Emperour.</note> fifteene yeares, a great part of mans age, many haue beene waſted by caſuall chances, the moſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and forwarde by the cruelty of the Prince, a fewe of vs onely remaining that haue ouerliued, as I may ſay, not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but alſo our ſelues, hauing ſo many yeares ſubducted out of the midſt of our life, in which wee proceeded in ſilence from youngmen to aged, from aged almoſt to the graue. And yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture it ſhall not repent me to compoſe, though in rude and vnframed ſpeech, a<note n="b" place="margin">By a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their thraldome, he meaneth, as I ſuppoſe, his bookes of <hi>Hiſt:</hi> by a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their preſent felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a volume intended by him of <hi>Nerua</hi> and <hi>Traians</hi> time (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the preface of the hiſtory) but ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer, I thinke, performed.</note> memory of our late thraldome, and a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our preſent felicities.

That noble and hawtie minde of his was cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to embrace, with more feruency then diſcretion, the bewty and gay ſhewe of that high and glorious profeſsion: but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon anone and riper yeares reformed his iudgement: and ſo hee retayned, a point moſt harde to bee kept, of wiſedome a meane.</p>
            <p>His firſt ſeruice in warre was in Britanny vnder Suetonius Paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus; into whoſe trayne being aſſumed hee was of that diligent and diſcrete leader well liked: not ſpending the time in riot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of youthes, which conuert warfare into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe; nor accepting the title of Tribuneſhippe without skill in the ſeruice, as a calling of eaſe for pleaſure and gadding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade; but wholly directing his minde to knowe the prouince, to bee knowen of the army, to learne of the skilfull, to follow the beſt, to deſire no imployment vpon vaine glory, to refuſe none for feare, ioyntly to ſhewe himſelfe both carefull and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in action.

            <p>From Britanny departing to Rome to beare offices he ioyned himſelfe in matrimony with Domitia Decidiana, a woman of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable birth: which mariage was a countenance, and a ſtrength to his further purpoſes: and they liued together in marueilous vnity with mutuall loue, and<note n="“" place="margin">Or, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence of the latine word, which may ſeeme doubtfull, and ech prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the other both vertuous alike, ſauing that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is ſo much the greater in a good wife, as the reproch is the more in a bad.</note> yeelding preeminence the one to the other; a point otherwiſe not greatly materiall, ſauing that a good wife is a great commendation, aſwell as an ill a reproch. Being Queſtor his lot fell in Aſia with Saluius Titianus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul. Neither was he withdrawen by that meanes from his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted integrity, although both the prouince was rich and readily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred matter to offende, and his Proconſull a man of inſatiable greedineſſe would with any remiſneſſe willingly haue redeemed at his handes mutuall conniuence and couering of faults. There his wife bare him a daughter both to his ſtay and his comfort, for the ſonne ſhe brought him before was already deceaſed hauing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but a little. After his Queſtorſhip till he was created Tribune of the people, &amp; the yeare alſo of his Tribuneſhip he paſſed ouer in reſt and quietneſſe, well weying the nature of Neroes time,<note n="a" place="margin">Tacit. <hi>1.</hi> Hiſt. <hi>ſpeaking of</hi> Galba, <hi>and the ſame times.</hi> claritas natali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; metus temporum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentui, vt quod ſegnitia erat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia vocare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> wherein ſlouth was a vertue, and to doe nothing the greateſt wiſedome of all. His Pretorſhip alſo he paſſed ouer in the ſame ſort, with the like ſilence: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> none of the iudiciall places happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> playes and vanities of the office he gouerned and executed by the rule of reaſon and meaſure of wealth: farre from exceſſe, and yet not without magnificence &amp; honour. Anone afterward being elected by Galba to view and ſuruey the iewels and giftes belonging to the temples, by moſt diligent and ſtraite ſearch hee procured full reſtitution of all, ſaue onely of thoſe which Nero had taken.</p>
            <p>The yeare following wounded his minde, &amp; plunged his houſe in a heauy miſhappe. For<note n="b" place="margin">Of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we read in <hi>Tacitus.</hi> 2. <hi>Hiſt. pag</hi> 66.</note> Othoes fleete rouing at large licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, in waſting Intemelium a part of Liguria, ſlew the mother of Agricola in her owne grounds, ſpoyled the grounds, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away moſt part of the wealth which was the cauſe of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As Agricola went to ſolemnize the funeralles he receaued aduiſe, that Veſpaſian was in armes for the Empire, and without
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18156:125"/> more aduiſe ioyned himſelfe to the ſide. Domitian as yet was but young, and challenged not, as an Emperours ſonne, any thing els ſaue only licentious life. The affayres of the Empire and ſtate of the Citty were gouerned at the beginning, and wholly directed by Mutianus alone. By commisſion from whom Agricola being ſent to take muſters, and behauing himſelfe in that charge with great integrity and courage, he was by the ſame Mutianus, vpon meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage receaued of the ſeditious demeanure of Roſcius Coelius, made in his place Lieutenant of the twentieth Legion, a Legion which ſlowly had ſworne to Veſpaſian, and was out of awe, or awed much rather euen the Lieutenants Generall; much leſſe was the Legions Lieutenant of power to refraine them, whether through the weakneſſe of his owne arme, or hard mouth of his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, it is not aſſured. Thus being elected both to ſucceede and reuenge, he ſhewed an example of moſt rare moderation, in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſeeme rather to haue founde, then to haue made, them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ſouldiers. At that time Vectius Bolanus was Lieutenant of Britannie, gouerning in a gentler &amp; milder maner, then was fit for ſo fierce a cuntrey. Vnder him Agricola cunningly conforming himſelfe to that humour, and not vnlearned to ioine profitable counſailes with honeſt, tempered the heate of his nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned from growing his hawty deſires. Soone after Petilius Cerealis was appointed Lieutenant Generall there: vnder whom the vertues of Agricola had a large field &amp; free ſcope to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in. For Cerealis communicated &amp; imparted vnto him, firſt himſelfe and his counſailes, then actions of labour and danger, &amp; laſtly glory alſo; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times for a proofe to his leading ſome portion of the army, ſometimes many more, according to the ſucceſſe. Neither did Agricola at any time bragge of his doings as ſeeking to winne fame for himſelfe, but humbly alwaies as a miniſter referred to his ſuperiour, and General, the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and honour of all his exploites. So by his vertue in valiantly doing his charge, and his modeſty in ſparingly ſpeaking thereof, he was without enuy, but not without glory.</p>
            <p>Vpon his returne from the Lieutenantſhippe of the Legion, Veſpaſian of ſacred memory elected him into the company of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Patritians, and afterward ſent him Lieutenant Generall into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitania, an honourable roome, both in reſpect of the office it ſelfe, &amp; as being a way to the Conſulſhip by the Prince purpoſed

            <p>The firſt of the Romans which entred Britannie with an army was Iulius Ceſar, who although he terrifyed the inhabitants with a battaile which went on his ſide, and gained the ſhoare, yet may ſeeme rather to haue ſhewed the place to poſterity, then deliuered to them the poſſesſion thereof.</p>

The Ordouices a little before hee entred the lande had cut a wing almoſt wholly in pieces, which lay in their borders. Vpon which beginning the cuntrey being awaked, as men deſirous of warre, allowed the example: ſome ſtaied to ſee how the new Lieutenant would take it. Agricola although the ſommer was ſpent, and the bandes lay diſperſed in the prouince, &amp; his ſoldiers had fully preſumed of reſt for that yeare, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered much, &amp; croſſed directly the vndertaking of warre, diuerſe alſo being of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather to keepe &amp; aſſure the places ſuſpected, al this notwithſtanding he reſolued directly to encounter the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: &amp; gathering the enſignes of the Legions, &amp; ſome fewe Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, becauſe the<note n="c" place="margin">Northwales.</note> Ordouices durſt not deſcende into indifferent ground, himſelfe firſt of all, to giue others like courage in the like danger, led vp to encounter the enemy. And hauing deſtroied al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole nation, knowing right well that fame muſt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be followed, and as the firſt ſhould fall out ſo the reſt would ſucceede, he deliberated to conquere the ilande of Mona; from the poſſeſsion whereof, as before I haue rehearſed, Paullinus was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18156:128"/> reuoked by the generall rebellion of Britanny: but as in a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not purpoſed before, ſhippes being wanting, the pollicy and reſoluteneſſe of the Captaine deuiſed a paſſage, commanding the moſt choiſe of the Aydes, to whom al the ſhallowes were knowen, and who after the vſe of their cuntrey were able in ſwimming to gouerne themſelues with armour and horſes, laying aſide their cariage, to put ouer at once and ſodainly inuade them. Which thing ſo amazed the enemy attending for ſhippes &amp; ſuch like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion by ſea, that ſurely beleeuing nothing could bee harde or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible to men which came ſo minded to warre, they humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for peace &amp; yeelded the ilande. Thus Agricola at his firſt entry into his prouince (which time others conſume in vaine oſten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation or ambitious ſeeking of ceremonies) entring withall into labours and dangers became famous indeede and of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Neither did he abuſe the proſperous proceeding of his affaires to vanity or brauing in ſpeeches. He termed it not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploite or a conqueſt to haue kept in order perſons ſubdued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: hee<note n="a" place="margin">A thing vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches wherein any notable victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth by <hi>Liuy. l.</hi> 45. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus. li.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 1491.</note> bedeckt not with lawrell his letters of aduertiſement, but ſtopping and ſuppreſsing the fame hee augmented the ſame, when men beganne to diſcourſe vpon what great preſumptions of future ſucceſſe, he ſhould make ſo light an account of ſuch great actions already performed.</p>
            <p>Now as touching his ciuill gouernement, Agricola knowing right well the diſpoſition and minde of the prouince, and taught alſo by experience of others, that armes auayle litle to ſettle a new conquered ſtate if iniuries and wrongs be permitted, determined to cut off all cauſes of warres and rebellions. And beginning at home, his houſe firſt of all he reformed and reſtrained, a point of more hardneſſe to ſome then to gouerne a prouince.

He would ſee into all things, not exact all things to the rigour: light faults he would pardon, and the great ſeuerely correct: not alwaies proceeding to puniſh, but often content with repentance: chuſing rather not to preferre to office and charge ſuch as were like to offende, then after the offence to condemne them.

            <p>The fift yeare of the warre Agricola firſt taking ſea went ouer, and ſubdued, with many and proſperous conflicts, nations before that time vnknowen, and furniſhed with forces that part of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie, which lieth againſt Irelande, more in hope then for feare. For Irelande if it might haue beene wunne, lying betweene Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie and Spaine, and fitly alſo for the French ſea, would aptlie haue vnited, to the great aduantage of the one &amp; the other, theſe ſtrongeſt members of the Empire togither. In bigneſſe it is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Britannie, howbeit bigger then the ilandes of<note n="a" place="margin">He meaneth the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands there, as <hi>Sicilie.</hi> &amp;c.</note> our ſea. The ſoyle and temperature of the aire, the nature and faſhions of the people, differ not much from the Brittiſh. The portes and places of acceſſe are more knowen, by reaſon of more frequenting of merchants. Agricola had receiued before a Prince of that cuntrey driuen out by ciuill diſſenſion, whom vnder coulour of curteſie and frendſhip he retained till occaſion ſhould ſerue. I haue heard him oftentimes ſay, that with one Legion &amp; ſome fewe Aydes, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande might be wunne &amp; poſſeſſed, and that it were alſo a ſtrength for our Brittiſh affaires, if the Roman forces were planted ech-where, and liberty, as it were, baniſht out of ſight. Now in the ſommer, which beganne the ſixt yeare of his office, becauſe a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall riſing in armes of all the further nations beyonde Bodotria was feared, and paſſages were all beſet with the power of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he manned a fleete to ſearch the creekes and harboroughs of the ample region beyonde it, backing then firſt of all with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy the reſt of his ſtrength, and with a goodly braue ſhewe bringing warre both by lande and by ſea. And oft ſo it chanced, that the horſeman and footeman and the ſea ſoldier met, and made merry in the ſame campe, extolling &amp; magnifying ech their owne prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe and aduentures: making their vaunts and compariſons ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierlike, the one of the woods and high mountaines, the other of dangers of tempeſts and waues: the one of the lande and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, the other of the Ocean, ſubdued. The Britans, as by the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners it was vnderſtoode, were amazed alſo at the ſight of the nauy, as though now the ſecrets of their ſea were diſcloſed, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge remained if they were ouercome. Whereupon the Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians arming with great preparation and greater fame, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is of matters vnknowen, aſſayled our caſtels as challengers,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18156:129"/> brauing and putting in feare: inſomuch that ſome of our ſide, which would ſeeme to bee wiſe being daſtards indeede, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Generall to retire on this ſide Bodotria, and rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of his owne accorde, then to be repelled with ſhame. In the meane ſeaſon Agricola hath knowledge, that the enemies ment to diuide themſelues, and to giue the onſet in ſeuerall companies. Whereupon leſt he ſhould be incloſed about, &amp; intrapped by their multitude and skill in the cuntrey, he marched alſo with his army diuided in three. Which when it was knowen to the enemy, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging aduiſe on the ſodayne, and vniting their forces togither, they ioyntly aſſaulted by night the nienth Legion, as being of weakeſt reſiſtance: and hauing ſlaine the watch, partly aſleepe &amp; partly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed with feare, brake into the campe. And now were they figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting within the trenches, when Agricola hauing vnderſtoode by ſpyes what way the enemies had taken, and following their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteppes, commandeth the lighteſt horſemen and footmen to play on their backes and maintayne the skirmiſh, &amp; anone the whole army to ſhowte. And when it drew neare to be day, the glittering of the enſeignes was ſeene. So the Britans being quayled with a double danger, the Romans recouered courage againe, and being out of perill of their perſons, fought now for their honour; freſhly aſſayling their late aſſaylers, &amp; driuing them to the gates: where in the ſtrayts the conflict was ſharpe &amp; cruell, till in the end the enemies were forced to flee, whileſt both our armies conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the one to ſeeme to haue helped their fellowes, the other to haue needed none other to helpe them: and if the bogges and woods had not couered their flight, that victory had ended the warre. Vpon this battaile ſo manfully fought, ſo famouſly wunne, the army preſuming that to their proweſſe all things were eaſy and open, cryed to leade into Caledonia, and to finde out the limit of Britannie with a courſe of continuall conqueſts: and thoſe which erewhile were ſo wary and wiſe, waxt forward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough after the euent, and grew to ſpeake bigly: ſuch is the hard condition of warres: if ought fall out well all challenge a part, misfortunes are onely imputed to one. Contrariwiſe the Britans preſuppoſing that not valure, but the cunning of the Generall, by vſing the occaſion, had caried it away, abated no whit of their ſtomacke, but armed their youth, tranſported their children and wiues into places of ſafety, and ſought by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18156:130"/> and religious rites to eſtabliſh an aſſociation of the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties togither. And ſo for that yeare both parties departed incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away.</p>
            <p>The ſame ſommer a cohort of Vſipians, leuyed in Germanie, and ſent ouer into Britannie, committed a haynous and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable act. For hauing ſlaine a Centurion and certaine ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſet ouer them for direction in diſcipline, they fled and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barcked themſelues in three veſſels, compelling the Maſters by force to execute their charge: and onely one doing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the other two being ſuſpected and thereupon ſlaine, this ſtrange going out, the fact being yet not noyſed abroad, was gazed and wondred at. Afterward beeing driuen vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hither and thither, and aſſayling the Britans which ſtoode in defence of their owne, often preuayling and ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, they came at the laſt to that miſery, that they were enforced to eate one another, firſt of the weakeſt, then as the lot lighted. And thus floating about Britannie, and leeſing their veſſels for lacke of gouernement, they were intercepted firſt by the Sueuians, and then by the Friſians, as pyrats and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſome of them being bought by merchants as ſlaues, and by change of maſters brought to our ſide of the riuer, grew into a name by giuing firſt notice of ſo great and ſo rare an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the ſommer Agricola was deepely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a grieuous miſchance, which happened in his owne houſe: for he loſt his owne ſonne being about a yeare olde. Which infortunate happe he neyther bare out, as ſome great men haue done in the like, vaingloriouſly, nor tooke it againe ſo impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently as women are woont: and amidſt his mourning and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes vſed the warre as one of his remedies. Therefore ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his nauy before, which by ſpoyling in ſundry places ſhould induce a greater and vncertainer terrour vpon them, hee made readie and followed himſelfe with his army, ioyning thereto ſome of the valianteſt Britans, whom by long experience in peace hee had found moſt faithfull, and ſo arriued at the mount<note n="a" place="margin">Now called Grantzbaine.</note> Grampius, where the enemies were lodged before. For the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans not daunted with the euent of the former battaile, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for nothing els but reuenge or ſeruitude, and beeing taught at the length that common danger muſt bee repelled with
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18156:130"/> concorde, by leagues and embaſſages had aſſembled the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all the citties togither, aboue thirty thouſand armed men, the view being taken, beſide an endles number of youth, which dayly flocked to them, and luſty olde men, renowned in warre and bearing the badges due to their honour: at what time Galgacus, for vertue and birth of all the leaders the principall man, ſeeing the multitude hoatly demande the battaile, is ſayed to haue vſed this ſpeech. <q rend="margQuotes">"When I view and conſider REND="margQuotes" the cauſe of this warre, and our preſent necesſity, I haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, me ſeemes, to preſume, that this day, and this your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſent, will giue a happy beginning to the freedome of the whole ilande. For both haue we all hitherto liued in liberty, and beſide no lande remayneth beyond, no ſea for our ſafety, the Roman nauy thus, as you ſee, ſurueying our coaſts: ſo that combat and armes, which men of vertue deſire for honour, the daſtard muſt alſo vſe for his ſecurity. The former battayles, which haue with diuerſe euent beene fought with the Romans, had their refuge, and hope reſting in our handes. For wee the flowre of the Brittiſh nobility, and ſeated therefore the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in, ſawe neuer the coaſts of the cuntreyes which ſerued in ſlauery, euen our eyes are kept vnpolluted, and free from all contagion of tyrannie. Beyonde vs is no lande, beſide vs none are free: vs hitherto this corner and ſecrete receſſe hath defended. Now the vttermoſt point of the lande is layed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: and things the leſſe they haue beene within knowledge, the greater the glory is to atchieue them. But what nation now is there beyonde vs? what els but water and rockes, and the Romans Lordes of all within lande? whoſe intollerable pride in vayne ſhall you ſeeke to auoyde by ſeruice and humble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour: robbers of the world, that hauing now left no lande to bee ſpoyled, ſearch alſo the ſea. If the enemy bee rich, they ſeeke to winne wealth: if poore, they are content to gaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: whom not the eaſt, not the weſt hath ſatisfyed: the onely men of all memory that ſeeke out all places, be they wealthy or poore, with like ardent affection. To take away by maine force, to kill and to ſpoile, falſely they terme Empire and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: when all is waſte as a wilderneſſe, that they call peace. His children and bloud ech man by nature holdeth moſt deare: thoſe are preſſed for ſouldiers, and caryed away
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18156:131"/> to bee ſlaues otherwhere. Our ſiſters and wiues, though they be not violently forced as in open hoſtility, are in the meane while vnder the coulour and title of frendes and gueſts often abuſed. Our goods and ſubſtance they drawe for tribute, our corne for prouiſion: our bodies and handes they weare and conſume, in pauing of bogges and of woods, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtripes and indignities. Slaues which are borne to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage are ſolde but once, and after are fed at their owners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes: but Britannie dayly byeth, dayly feedeth, and is at charges with her owne bondage. And as in a priuate retinue the freſhman and laſt commer is laughed and ſcoffed at by his very fellow-ſeruants, ſo in this olde ſeruitude of the whole world our deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely is ſought, as being the lateſt and moſt vile in account. We haue no fieldes to manure, no mines to be digged, no portes to trade in: &amp; to what purpoſe then ſhould they reſerue vs aliue? Moreouer the manhood and fierce courage of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect pleaſeth not much the ielous Souerayne: and this corner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſecrete and out of the way, the more ſecurity it yeeldeth to vs, in them it workes the greater ſuſpicion. So ſeeing all hope of pardon is paſt, at the length take courage, to defend &amp; maintaine your ſafety as well as your honour. The Brigantes led by a<note n="a" place="margin">

Or doe you thinke the Romans to be as valiant in warre as they are wanton in peace? No, not by their vertue, but by our iarrings and diſcordes they are growen into fame: and the faults of their enemies they abuſe to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their owne army compoſed of moſt diuerſe nations, and therefore as by preſent proſperity holden togither, ſo if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune doe frowne it doubtleſſe diſſolueth: vnleſſe you ſuppoſe the Frenchmen and Germans, and, to our ſhame bee it ſpoken, many of our owne nation, which now lende their liues to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a forreyne vſurper, and yet haue bene enemies longer then ſeruants, to be led and induced with any true harted &amp; faithfull affection. No, it is terrour and feare, weake workers of loue, which if you remooue, thoſe which ſhall haue ceaſed to feare
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18156:131"/> will ſtraight beginne for to hate. All things to incite to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie are on our ſide. No wife to encourage the Romans: no parents to vpbrayde them if they flee: moſt haue eyther no cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey at all, or ſome other: a fewe fearefull perſons, trembling and gazing at the ſtrangeneſſe of the heauen it ſelfe, the ſea and the woods: whom the gods haue deliuered mewed vp, as it were, and fettered into our handes. Let not the vaine ſhewe and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of golde and ſiluer terrifie vs, which neither defends nor offendeth. Amongſt the enemies we ſhall finde of our ſide: the Britans will agnize their owne cauſe: the French will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their freedome and former eſtate: the reſt of the Germans will leaue and forſake them, as of late the Vſipians did. And what els then haue we to feare? the caſtels are empty, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies peopled with aged and impotent perſons; the free citties diſcontent and in factions, whileſt thoſe which are vnder obey with ill will, and they which doe gouerne rule againſt right. Here is the Generall and here the army, there tributes and mines, and other miſeries inſeparably following them which liue vnder ſubiection of others: which whether wee are to continue for euer, or ſtraight to reuenge, it lyeth this day in this field.

This ſpeech was cheerefully receiued, with a ſong after their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous faſhion, with confuſed acclamations and noyſes. And as the companies cluſtered togither, and gliſtering of armour appeared, whileſt ſome of the boldeſt auanced forward, and withall the ranckes were putting themſelues in array, Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la albeit his ſouldier was glad of that day, and ſcarce could with wordes bee withholden, ſuppoſing yet beſt to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, encouraged them in this wiſe. Fellow-ſouldiers and companions in armes, your faithfull ſeruice and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, theſe<note n="b" place="margin">And yet this was but the ſeuenth yeare of his office, as appeareth before.</note> eight yeares ſo painfully ſhewed, by the vertue and fortune of the Roman Empire hath conquered Britannie. In ſo many iourneyes, in ſo many battels wee had of necesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſhewe our ſelues eyther valiant againſt the enemie, or patient and laborious aboue and againſt nature it ſelfe. In which exploytes we haue borne vs both hitherto ſo, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I deſire better ſouldiers, nor you other captayne. We haue exceeded the limits, I of my predeceſſours, and you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

The ende of Britannie is found, not by fame and report, but we are with our armes and pauilions really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted thereof: Britannie is found and ſubdued. In marching, when the pasſing of bogges, or mountaynes, and riuers, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and tired you out, how oft haue I heard the valiant ſouldier ſay, When wil the enemy preſent himſelfe? when ſhall wee fight? lo they are now put vp out of their holes: and here they are come: your wiſh lo here, and place for your vertue, and all things to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in an eaſy and expedite courſe, if you winne; if you leeſe, all againſt you. For as to haue gone ſo much ground, eſcaped the woods, paſſed ouer the firthes, is honourable forward, ſo if we doe flee, the vantages we haue this day will become our moſt diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. For wee are not skilled ſo well in the cuntreys, wee haue not the like ſtore of prouiſion, but hands wee haue and weapons, and therein all things included. For my part I am long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, that to ſhewe their backes is neyther ſafetie for ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier nor Generall: and therefore a commendable death is better then life with reproch; and ſurety and honour are commonly dwelling togither: or if ought ſhould miſhappen, euen this will be a glory, to haue dyed in the vttermoſt ende of the world and nature. If new nations, and ſouldiers vnknowen were in the field, I would, by the example of other armies, put you in courage: now recount you your owne victorious exploytes, &amp; aske your owne eyes. Theſe are the ſame men, which the laſt yeare aſſayled one Legion by ſtealth in the night, and were by a blaſt of your mouth ouerthrowen: theſe of all other Britans haue beene the moſt nimble in running away, and therefore haue ſcaped the longeſt aliue. For as in forreſts and woods the ſtrongeſt beaſts are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away by maine force, the cowardly and fearefull are ſcared by the noiſe of the hunters, ſo the valiant of the Brittiſh natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue already diſpatched, the raſcall heard of daſtardly cowards onely remayneth: whom at length you haue found, not as hauing inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſtay and make head, but as laſt ouertaken, and by extreme pasſion of feare ſtanding as ſtocks, preſenting occaſion to vs in this place of a worthy and memorable victory.</q> Make an ende therefore of your warfare, and to<note n="a" place="margin">From the firſt entry of <hi>Claudius</hi> into <hi>Britannie</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to haue bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fower or fiue and forty yeares.</note> fifty yeares trauayles let this day impoſe a glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18156:132"/> As Agricola was yet ſpeaking, the ſouldiers gaue great tokens of feruency, and when he had ended accompanied the ſpeech with a ioyfull applauſe, and ranne ſtraightwaies to their weapons. Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola ſeeing them ſufficiently animated, and ruſhing furiouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ordered his men in this maner. With the Auxiliary foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being eight thouſand, hee fortified the middle battell: three thouſand horſe hee put on both ſides in the wings; commanding the Legions to ſtand behinde, before the trench of the campe, to the greater glory of the victory, if it were obtained without Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bloud, otherwiſe for aſsiſtance and ſuccour, if the vantgard ſhould be repelled. The Britans were marſhalled in the higher ground, fitly both to the ſhew and to terrifie, the firſt batalion ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the plaine, the reſt in the aſcent of the hill, knit and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as it were one ouer another: the middle of the fielde was filled with the clattering and running of<note n="*" place="margin">Couinarius.

Then Agricola perceiuing the enemie to exceede him in number, and fearing leſt he ſhould be aſſayled on the front and flanckes both at one inſtant, diſplaied his army in length: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by that meanes the battell would become diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably long, and many aduized him to take in the Legions, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more forward to hope, then yeelding to feare, hee reiected the counſaile, and leauing his horſe auanced himſelfe before the enſeignes on foote. In the firſt encounter, before the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both ſides diſcharged and threw: wherein the Britans em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying both arte and valure, with their great ſwordes and little targets, auoyded our throwes, or ſhooke them off, darting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all great ſtore againſt vs of theirs: till at length Agricola ſpying his vantage exhorted three Batauian cohorts, and two of the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grians to preſſe forward, and bring the matter to handy ſtrokes and dint of the ſworde; a thing which they in reſpect of long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice were able readily to performe, and contrarily to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies preiudiciall, and hurtfull by reaſon of their little bucklers, &amp; huge ſwordes: for the ſwordes of the Britans, being blunt pointed, were no way fit for the cloſe or for open fight. Now as the Bataui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans beganne to deale blowes, to ſtrike with the pikes of their buck<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers, to mangle their faces, and hauing ouerborne in the plaine all that reſiſted, to march vp the mountaines, the reſt of the cohortes gathering courage vpon emulation violently bet downe al about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; many halfe dead, or wholly vntouched, were left for haſt of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18156:133"/> winning the fielde. In the meane time the charets mingled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the battell of the footemen, and the troupes of the horſemen beganne for to flee: who albeit they had lately terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others, were now diſtreſſed themſelues by the vneuenneſſe of the ground, and thicke ranckes of their enemies. Neither was the forme of the fight like a looſe skirmiſh of horſemen to and fro, but ſtanding ſtill and maintaining their places they ſought by maine weight of horſes, to breake and beare downe one another. The wandring wagons alſo, and maſterleſſe horſes afrighted, as it happened them by feare to be guyded, ouer-bare many times of their frendes which met them, or thwarted their way. Now the Britans, which ſtoode aloofe from the battell on the height of the hilles, and at their good leyſure diſdained our fewneſſe, beganne to come downe by little and little, &amp; to compaſſe about the backs of our men, which were now in traine of winning the fielde: but Agricola ſuſpecting as much, oppoſed againſt them fower wings of horſemen purpoſely retayned about him for ſodaine diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and chances of warre, and repulſed them backe as ſharply, as fiercely they ranne to aſſayle. So the counſaile of the Britans tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon their owne heades: and the wings were commanded to forſake the battell and follow the flight. Then might you haue ſeene in the open fields a grieuous and pitifull ſpectacle, purſuing, wounding, taking, and killing of them which were taken when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were offered. Now whole regiments of the enemies, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeuerall diſpoſitions, though armed and moe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, turned their backes to the fewer: others vnarmed ſought their owne death, offering themſelues voluntarily to the ſlaughter. Euery where weapons lay ſcattered and bodies, and mangled limmes: the ground euery where imbrued with bloud: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times euen in them which were ouercome, appeared now at their ende both anger and valure. When they approched the woods, vniting themſelues, they intrapped vnawares ſome of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our men, which vnaduizedly followed, not knowing the cuntrey: and vnleſſe Agricola had with his preſence euerywhere aſsiſted at neede, ſetting about them of his braueſt and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die footemen, as it were in forme of a toyle, and commanding ſome of his horſemen to leaue their horſes where the paſſages were narrow, and others where the wood was thinne to enter on horſebacke, no doubt wee had taken ſome blowe by our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

But after they ſawe our men againe in ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray to follow the chace in good order, they fled, not in troupes as before, and attending ech other, but vtterly disbanded and ſingle, eſchewing all companie, towarde the deſert and farre diſtant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

That night the winners for their partes ſolaced themſelues with the victory and ſpoyle: and the Britans being vtterly broken, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and howling, men and women togither, take and draw with them their hurt perſons, call the not hurt, forſake their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in deſpite alſo ſet them on fire themſelues, chuſe out holes for to lurke in, &amp; ſtraightwaies forſake them, communicate ſome counſailes togither, and then haue ſome glimring of hope: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the ſight of their dearelyeſt beloued they are mooued to pitty, more often ſtirred to rage: and certaine it is that ſome, as by way of compaſsion and mercy, ſlew their owne children &amp; wiues. The day following diſcouered more plainly the greatneſſe of the victory. Euery where deſolation and ſilence: no ſtirring in the mountaines: the houſes fired and ſmoking farre of; no man to meete with our ſpies; who being ſent abroade into all quarters founde by their footſteps the flight was vncertaine, and that they were no where in companies togither.

With theſe and the like cares being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and muſing much in his cloſet alone, which was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſigne of ſome cruelty intended, he thought it yet beſt for the preſent to diſſemble and put ouer his malice, vntill the heate of his glorie and loue of his ſouldiers were ſomewhat abated; for as yet Agricola remayned in charge. Wherefore hee commanded that all the honours of triumphall ornaments,<note n="*" place="margin">Illuſtris ſtatuae honorem. <hi>1.</hi> Hiſt. triumphalis ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua.</note> image triumphall, and what els vſually was conferred in liew of triumph, ſhould bee awarded vnto him in Senate in moſt ample and honourable tearmes: and ſending a ſucceſſour cauſed withall a bruite to bee ſpred, that the prouince of Syria, which then lay voide, by the death of Atilius Rufus the Lieutenant, and was reſerued for men of great qualitie, was purpoſed vnto him. And a common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion went, that Domitian ſending one of his moſt ſecrete and truſtie ſeruants to Agricola, ſent withall the patent of Syria, with inſtruction, that if hee were in Britannie it ſhould bee deliuered: and that the ſame man meeting Agricola as hee croſſed the ſeas, without ſpeaking vnto him, or deliuering his meſſage, returned againe to Domitian. Whether this were true, or fayned and ſurmized probably, as correſpondent to the Princes diſpoſition, I cannot affirme: but in the meane ſeaſon Agricola had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his ſucceſſour the prouince in good and peaceable ſtate. And leſt his arriuall at Rome ſhould bee noted, by reaſon of the multitudes of people which would goe out to ſee and to meete him, cutting off that curteſie of his frendes, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the cittie by night, and by night, as hee was willed, came
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18156:134"/> to the Palace. Where being admitted to the Princes preſence, and receiued with a ſhort ſalutation and no ſpeech, hee ſorted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the reſt of the waiters. Now to the ende hee might temper and qualifie with other good parts his militare renowne, a vertue vnpleaſant to men of no action, hee gaue himſelfe wholly to quietneſſe and medling with nothing; being in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell moderate, affable in ſpeech, accompanied vſually but by one or two of his frendes: ſo that many, which commonly iudge of great men by the outwarde apparence and pompe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and marking Agricola, miſſed of that which by ſame they conceyued, fewe aimed aright at the cauſe. Often was hee in thoſe dayes accuſed to Domitian in abſence, and in abſence acquitted. The cauſe was neither matter of crime, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of partie aggrieued, but the renowne of the man, and the Princes diſpoſition hating all vertue, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> the moſt capitall kinde of enemies commenders, procured the perill. And in trueth thoſe times enſued in the ſtate, which would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Agricolaes name to bee buried in ſilence: ſo manie armies in Moeſia, Dacia, Germanie, Pannonia, eyther through the raſhneſſe or cowardlineſſe of the Generals caſt awaie: ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good ſouldiers, with ſo manie cohortes defeated and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Neither was it the queſtion then for the vttermoſt boundes of the Empire and bancke of the Riuer, but the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding campes of the Legions, and the prouinces themſelues were in danger of leeſing: ſo that loſſes beeing heapt vpon loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and euerye yeare becomming notorious for ſome cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and ouerthrowe, Agricola was required by the ſpeech of the people for Generall, euerye man comparing his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, reſoluteneſſe, and experience in warre, with their inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and daſtardly dealings: with which kinde of talke, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowen, Domitians eares were not vnacquainted; his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt ſeruants vpon loue and alleageance, the reſt vpon ſpite and enuy pricking him forwarde, being of himſelfe prone to the worſe. So Agricola partly through his owne vertues, and partlie the vices of others, was drawen headlong perforce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glorie. Now the yeare was at hande, whenas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſulſhippe of Aſia or Africke ſhould bee allotted vnto him, and vpon the late murdering of<note n="a" place="margin">Suetonius Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiano. c. <hi>10.</hi> complures ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, in his ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot conſulares interemit, in quibus Ciuicam Cerealem in ipſo Aſiae proconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis.</note> Ciuica, neyther could Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian fayle of example to follow, nor Agricola of direction
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18156:135"/> what he ſhould doe. Some alſo priuy to the Princes ſecret intents offered ſpeech of themſelues, and asked him whether he could be content to accept of the gouernement: commending at the firſt a farre off a quiet life and voide of buſines, and proffering anone their mediation to the Prince to allow his excuſe. At the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their purpoſe in plaine termes, by perſwaſion and threats they induced him to become a direct ſuitour in that behalfe to Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitian: who ſetting a fained countenance vpon it, and compoſing himſelfe to keepe maieſty and ſtate, both heard his humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excuſing himſelfe from that charge, and when the excuſe was admitted ſuffred himſelfe to be ſolemnely thanked, and was not aſhamed of ſo odious a benefite. Howbeit the penſion, which was woont to be offered to men of that quality, and by him had beene granted to certaine, he did not beſtowe vpon Agricola: either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended it was not ſued for, or vpon the guiltineſſe of his owne conſcience, leſt thereby hee ſhould ſeeme to haue bought out<note n="a" place="margin">That is, his going into the prouince.</note> that thing, which he had forbidden. It is the property of mans nature to hate thoſe whom he hath hurted: beſide Domitian was prone and headlong to anger, and the more cloſe the more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable, yet was hee notwithſtanding altered and mollified by Agricolaes diſcretion and wary behauiour: for hee did not with obſtinacy, nor vaine oſtentation of liberty, neither haſten his fame nor his fall. Let them well knowe that are woont to admire thoſe things alone, which are done againſt the ſtreame of the time, that great men may be found euen vnder bad Princes; that dutifull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and modeſty, if induſtry and valure bee ioyned, may attaine to that degree of praiſe and renowne, which ſome follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing dangerous courſes haue aſpired vnto by an ambitious death, without any further profit at all.</p>
            <p>The ende of his life brought mourning to vs, and grieffe to his frends, and euen by ſtrangers and perſons vnknowen was lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the common ſort alſo, and this retchles people of ours, both came oft to his houſe, and in all publicke places and meetings had it in ſpeech, neither did any perſon, when he heard of his death, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyce or ſodainly forget it. And that which procured the greater compaſsion was a conſtant report, that hee was made away by poyſon. Of mine owne knowledge I dare aſſure nothing this onely, that during the time of his ſickneſſe there came from Domitian, oftener then vſually are woont from Princes, who viſit
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18156:135"/> by others, both of his ſecreteſt ſeruants &amp; neareſt phiſicians to ſee him, whether as of carefulnes, or onely to ſpie I leaue it vncertaine: certaine it is, that the day of his death, euery degree of his going away was caried in poſt to the Prince; and fewe men beleeued the news ſhould be haſtened ſo much, that he would be ſory to heare. Notwithſtanding he made ſhewe of ſorrow in minde and in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, being now out of danger<note n="a" place="margin">That is, of the vertuous qualities of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola.</note> of that which hee hated, and one that more eaſily could diſſemble his ioy then his feare. When Agricolaes teſtament was read, wherein hee made Domitian co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heire with his moſt deare wife and moſt duetifull daughter, it was certaine hee greatly reioyced thereat, as if it had beene a ſigne of honour, or proceeded of iudgement: ſo blinded hee was, and ſo greatly corrupted by continuall cuſtome of flatteries, that hee could not perceaue, that no good father did euer appoint for his heyre any Prince but a tyranne. Agricola was borne the thirteenth day of Iune, Caius Caeſar being third time Conſull, and dyed the<note n="b" place="margin">Fower and fiftieth, at the moſt for from <hi>Caius Caeſar.</hi> 3. <hi>conſ.</hi> to <hi>Collegae</hi> and <hi>Priſcus</hi> Conſuls were no more but fifty three yeares, but ſo is the faſhion not only of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> but of other Hiſtory-writers, to miſrecken in a maner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to the more.</note> ſix and fiftieth yeare of his age, the fower and twentieth day of Auguſt, Collega and Priſcus beeing Conſuls. Of perſonage (if poſterity deſire to bee informed thereof) hee was rather well proportioned then tall, with an aſſuredneſſe and great grace in his countenance:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> a good man you would eaſily thinke him, and willingly a great. And although hee died in the middle courſe of his ripe age, in reſpect of honour and glory he liued with the longeſt: for of all the parts of true felicity, which conſiſteth in vertue, hee had fulfilled the meaſure: and hauing obtayned beſide Conſulare and triumphall ornaments, what more could fortune annexe to his eſtate? exceſſe of riches he delighted not in; honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably hee had and according to his degree. Yea happy may he be thought and happy indeede, that eſcaped thoſe tempeſts which followed, leauing behinde him a daughter and wife, his honour not ſtayned, his fame not touched, his frendes and allies in flowri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſtate. For as in our hearing hee wiſhed and hoped to liue and laſt to the light of this moſt bleſſed age, and ſee<note n="c" place="margin">Then it muſt be by way of prophecy, not of diſcourſe: for in <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> time there was no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at all of that ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Traian eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Prince, ſo his haſtened death had this great comforte, that he liued not to ſee that laſt and moſt miſerable time, in the which Domitian, not at ſeaſons and by fittes, but with a continuall courſe and at one blowe, as it were, ruined the ſtate. Agricola liued not to ſee the Senate-houſe beſet, the Senate enuironed with ſouldiers, and all in one fury the death of ſo many Conſulare

Some counſayle no doubt, and ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts wee ſhould haue receaued in charge to print and engraue in our harts: this is our grieffe, this our ſpeciall miſfortune: to vs, in reſpect of our long abſence fower yeares before, thou waſt loſt. And albeit thy moſt louing wife the beſt of all mothers ſat by, and furniſhed no doubt all things in moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſort, yet waſt thou layed vp with fewer teares, and at thy laſt hower thine eyes miſſed ſomewhat. If there bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place for the ghoſts of good men, if, as wiſe men define, the ſoules of great perſons die not with the body, in peace mayeſt thou reſt, and recall vs thy poſterity from impatient and womaniſh waylings to the contemplation of thy vertues, which are in no ſort to bee ſorrowed for, or bewayled, but rather admired. * * * * * * * * This is true honor indeede, &amp; this is the duety of neareſt kinsfolkes.

That of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola which wee did loue, which wee admired, remayneth, and ſo will remaine, in the mindes of men, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſucceſsion of ages, in fame and renowne. For manie of the ancients ſhall lie buried in obſcure and inglorious obliuion, but Agricola ſhall liue recommended to poſteritie, and continue for euer.</p>

So that to roue at that which it was our autours fault not to ſet downe plainly, we may imagin, that Paullinus and Celſus were ſent afterward from Brixellum to the campe at Bebriacum, either to take ioynt-charge with Gallus, or els charge in his place, as it is more likely, and that thereupon Gallus withdrew himſelfe, percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to recouer his fal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned p. 76, ſeeing there is no mention of him in the action <hi>ad Caſtoris;</hi> &amp; in an action which paſſed at Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briacum, wee ſhall finde him by and by away, where notwithſtanding Tacitus laſt left him, p. 70.
