            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For learning nature acknowledgeth a rea≈øon, by leauing indu≈øtrie to fini≈øh her vnperfect worke: for without learning the conceyte is like a fruitefull ≈øoyle without tilling, the memorie like a ≈øtorehou≈øe without wares, the will like a ≈øhippe without a rudder.

            <p>Anone as the tumult beganne, it is ≈øuppo≈øed crediblie, that Nero had purpo≈øed to haue made awaie all the gouernours of armies and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces as being con≈øpired again≈øt him; to murder all exiled per≈øons, le≈øt they ≈øhould ioyne them≈øelues with the rebels; all French hee could finde in the Cittie, as being frendes to the cau≈øe; to poy≈øon the Senate in banquet; to ≈øet a fire the citty, turning in wilde bea≈øtes among them which endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ≈øtoppe the cour≈øe of the flame. But ≈øetting apart the deui≈øe, not as di≈øliking, being ≈øo ≈øuteable to his proceeding, but as de≈øpairing to bring it about, hee determined a voyage in per≈øon, ≈øending before in the meane ≈øea≈øon Petronius Turpilianus, and Rubrius Gallus vvith certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against them.

Jn riding along his hor≈øe ≈øtarting a≈øide his face was di≈øcouered, and hee knowen and ≈øaluted by one of the Garde vvhich met him by chance. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon for≈øaking hor≈øe and high vvaie, through bu≈øhes and breres he crept in at the last into a thicket of reedes on the backside of Phaons ferme-hou≈øe, who per≈øwading Nero in the meane while to ≈øit in a pitte, out of the vvhich ≈øande had beene digged, hee refu≈øed the fauour, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to goe aliue vnder ground, and ≈øo cast him≈øelfe downe clo≈øe in the reedes, till they had beaten a hole in the wall, through which Nero vpon all foure crept into the backside, casting him≈øelfe vpon a ≈øimple pallet in a backe roome.</p>
            <p>VVhile≈øt Nero thus lurcked, the Senate a≈ø≈øembled in coun≈øaile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him enemie of the state and puni≈øhable <hi>more maiorum,</hi> ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out to ≈øeeke him and bring him aliue. Concerning the choi≈øe of a new, although in their ≈øecrete opinions Verginius de≈øerued to re≈øume the benefite which hee had put into their handes, yet beeing not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter into further troubles, and rai≈øe vp a new ciuill warre, vvithout vvhich Galba, who had alreadie foreprized the place could not bee ≈øette downe, following the ≈øouldiers example they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie agreed all vpon Galba. By this time they about Nero were in≈øtant vpon him to rid him≈øelfe quickelie out of the contumelies and indignities, which anone he ≈øhould be forced to endure. To whom yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him≈øelfe hee commandes to make readie for the funeralles, vvee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and vvailing at euerie vvord, vvhat great pitie it was, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18156:9"/> ≈øo good a min≈øtrell ≈øhould bee ≈øo ca≈øt awaie.

And now the hor≈øemen ≈øent by the Senate approched, vvhich Nero perceiuing, by feare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged ranne him≈øelfe thorow, Epaphroditus his Secretarie at his reque≈øt helping to di≈øpatch him the ≈øooner, for vvhich ≈øeruice he was afterward put to death by Domitian: who thought it not meete to ≈øuffer anie to liue, which had in anie ≈øort lent his hand to the death of a Prince. Thus Nero, a Prince in life contemptible, and hatefull in gouernement, hauing thereby di≈øarmed him≈øelfe both of the loue and feare of his ≈øubiects, ended his daies the eightth of Iune in the one and thirtieth yeare of his age, and fourteenth of his Empire, at the first ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ruled the state with rea≈øonable liking, in≈øomuch that Traian was wonted to ≈øaie, that euen good Princes were ≈øhort of Neroes fiue yeares: but after breaking forth into all infamous behauiour, and dete≈øtable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions and cruelties, and beeing withall a Prince weake in action, not of vertue ≈øufficient to vpholde his vices by might, he was at the length thus ouerthrowen.</p>
            <p>Nero beeing ≈ølaine, the people and Gentlemen, but principallie the nobilitie, the principall obiect of tyrannie, ≈øacrificed to the gods and feasted for ioie: ≈øome al≈øo ware Bonnets, as beeing newlie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchi≈øed. The Senate a≈øsembled againe decreeth thankes to Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidius in most exqui≈øite maner, extolling his high vvi≈øedome and tender care ouer the state: confirmeth to Galba all princelie prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues and imperiall tiles; making thereof a publicke in≈øtrument, which the Con≈øuls ≈øent him in post: and moreouer concludeth vpon a ≈øolemne emba≈øsage of honourable per≈øonages vvith instructions, be≈øide congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations and complementes, humblie to de≈øire vvith ≈øpeede his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence at Rome. Then vvas it propo≈øed, that information might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede again≈øt the accu≈øers. The matter concerned ≈øome mightie men, vvhich had liued in times pa≈øt by the lo≈øse of their neighbours, and

Notwith≈øtanding their doings were ≈øo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øted, and the memorie of their malice ≈øo fre≈øh, that the order pa≈ø≈øed by voices in Senate, making them all, with the re≈øt of the mini≈øters of Neroes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, puni≈øhable <hi>more maiorum:</hi> but was executed onelie again≈øt ≈øome ba≈øe per≈øons, which had gained but little, &amp; done little harme: the principal malefactours brake thorow vvell enough and e≈øcaped the danger.</p>
            <p>While matters thus pa≈øsed in France and at Rome, in Spaine Galbaes ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in part were in termes to for≈øake him, and hardly reclaimed. About the ≈øame time al≈øo a freedman of Nero had be≈øtowed vpon Galba a pre≈øent of bondmen prepared for a practi≈øe: who according to their in≈øtructions wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching opportunities, as Galba by a narrow pa≈ø≈øage entred the bath, v≈øing their toungs, when time was, for hands, and exhorting one another not to let ≈ølippe the occa≈øion, were ≈øodainlie apprehended, and being examined what occa≈øion they ment, and put to the racke confe≈ø≈øed the trea≈øon. Anone after the≈øe hazards ≈øo hardly e≈øcaped, the newes came to Galba of Vindex death, and that vpon ≈øo great a victorie mo≈øt men vvere vvilling Verginius ≈øhould take the Empire vpon him, or els would returne to Nero againe. Galba ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremelie afraide writes to Verginius, be≈øeeching him mo≈øt in≈øtantly to ioine in defence of the libertie and Empire of Rome: him≈øelfe notwith≈øtanding as de≈øtitute and forlorne, and wearie of the world that vvent ≈øo again≈øt him, leauing Vinius Lieutenant in the armie, retireth to Clunia, repenting of that hee had done, and wi≈øhing againe his priuate e≈øtate, as though in this ca≈øe there were anie meane betweene hie≈øt and nothing. Thus being di≈øtre≈ø≈øed and angui≈øht in minde without any care of him≈øelfe or the cau≈øe, in very good ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon comes Icelus his freedman from Rome in ≈øeuen daies thither, reporting that Nero being yet aliue, but not to be founde, the ≈øoldier, the Senate &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had pronounced Galba Prince, that ≈øtraight thereupon Nero was ≈øaied to bee ≈ølaine, but him≈øelfe not beleeuing it went to the place, ≈øaw him lie dead, and ≈øo came his way. Two daies after Vinius came from the campe, declaring to him the particular points of the Senates decree. Galba receiuing the newes with great ioy, as greatly aboue expectation, priuiledgeth Icelus to weare golde rings, aduanceth Vinius to chiefe place in credit about him: and laying a≈øide the name of Lieutenant, a≈øsumeth the title of Cae≈øar, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Cornelius Laco to be captaine of his garde, &amp; iudging his pre≈øence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsary to ≈øettle the ≈øtate, giueth out order for his viage to Rome with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by lande.</p>
            <p>Now at Rome Nymphidius making his count that Neroes fall was his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deede, that no reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pence is ≈øufficient for be≈øtowing the diademe but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ademe,

The Garde in re≈øpect of their donatiue, were at his deuotion, to bee employed as he ≈øhould direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. The Lords of the Senate courted him daily, &amp; ≈øeemed to depend wholly vpon him. VVhereupon v≈øurping autority vndue to his place, he commands by &amp; by Tigellinus his companion to put off his ≈øworde and ≈øurcea≈øe from his office. The Con≈øuls vpon a di≈øplea≈øure, that they had ≈øent the publicke patents not by his ≈øouldiers, nor ≈øigned with his ≈øeale, the curriers commi≈ø≈øion, he had once determined to haue depriued. And laying the plot for him≈øelfe he biddeth to ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>quet the principal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the City: he ≈øettes vnder hand to put in the ≈øoldiers heads to pre≈øent ≈øupplication to Galba, to e≈øtabli≈øh Nymphidius captaine for life without any fellowe. To plea≈øure the people &amp; get the good wil of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he permittes them to vex &amp; torment whom they could catch of Neroes crew. Spicillus the<note n="‚Äú" place="margin">Gladiator.</note> fencer they tied vnder the images of Nero, trailed him along thorow the ≈øtreetes, and di≈øpatcht him in the Place of publicke a≈ø≈øembly. Aponius an accu≈øer, they ouerthrew, and drew cartes laden vvith ≈øtones o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his bodie, be≈øide manie other outraged and ≈ølaine, and ≈øome, as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth where the reine is let loo≈øe to the furious multitude, innocently: in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in Senate a graue &amp; honourable coun≈øeller openlie prote≈øted, that in ≈øhort time there would be great cau≈øe to wi≈øh Nero againe, as beeing more tolerable one tiranne then manie, and better to liue vvhere nothing then there vvhere al things were lawful. Thus Nimphidius, ≈øonne to Nimphidia a libertine an olde ≈øeruant in court and Martianus a fencer, ≈øecretelie a≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Empire, vvorking in Rome by certaine gratious vvomen and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours, and ≈øending to Spaine Gellianus one of his frendes to e≈øpie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and actions of Galba.</p>
            <p>Macer in Africke, the ≈øtate being troubled, mu≈øtered men, and pretended for him≈øelfe: but being for auarice and cruelty hated extremely, and finding no followers, could neither maintaine it vvith ≈øtrength nor leaue it vvith ≈øafetie. Galuia Cri≈øpinilla Neroes ≈øchoolemi≈øtre≈øse in matter of plea≈øure and lu≈øt, when Nero was dead, mi≈ødoubting mi≈øchances, ≈øailed into Africke, by her adui≈øe Macer be≈øet the ≈øea coa≈øts, and forbad any corne ≈øhould be tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ported, meaning to fami≈øh the cittie of Rome.

But Fabius Valens, Lieutenant there of a Legion, then greatly befrending Galbaes part, ≈øware to him fir≈øt hee with his companie, and the re≈øt of the armie followed the example. Verginius,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18156:11"/> the onelie concurrent of Galba in ≈øpeech of the people, hauing ouerthrowen <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>index and ma≈øtered France, notwith≈øtanding his ≈øoldiers, after the death of Nero vvas knowen, pre≈ø≈øed him againe in ≈øuch vehement ≈øort, that one of the Tribunes drawing his ≈øworde willed him to accept of it or the Empire, per≈øi≈øted con≈øtantlie in his fir≈øt re≈øolution: and receauing anone adui≈øe of the Senates decree, him≈øelfe mo≈øt willinglie, his ≈øouldiers hardlie, &amp; vvith much adoe were per≈øwaded, ≈øith lower Germanie had ≈øworne to ≈øweare allegeance to Galba. The re≈øt of the prouinces without anie difficultie accepted him all.</p>
            <p>Now Galba di≈øpo≈øing as Prince the affaires of the Empire, fineth the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Spaine, which were not ≈øo forward to further the cau≈øe, and ≈øome he di≈ømantelleth: certaine Procuratours and officers he putteth to death, their vviues and their children, a crueltie practi≈øed no not by Nero, much le≈ø≈øe expected in Galbaes beginnings. He directeth out warrant to Trebonius Garrucianus Procuratour of Africa to put Macer to death, di≈ømi≈ø≈øe the Legion lately mu≈øtered, and quiet the cuntrey: and appointes in Verginius place Hordeonius Flaccus Lieutenant in Germanie. Then without coat-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on backe a ≈øicklie olde man, him≈øelfe &amp; his men in warlike order march ouer the mountaines. The citties of France that tooke part again≈øt Vindex he puni≈øheth with lo≈øse of reuenew and cuntrey: the re≈øt were relieued, their tributes a quarter abated, them≈øelues made cittizens of Rome by meanes of their money, and Vinius; vvho carying an ill minde, and ≈øeruing in great place a weake ma≈øter, made open ≈øale of his Princes free graces and fauours. At Narbon the emba≈ø≈øadours ≈øent from the Senate met him in duetifull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whom Galba receaued curteou≈ølie with frendly and familiar ≈øpeeches, and fea≈øted in ≈øober ≈øort all with his owne, though otherwi≈øe hee had plentie there of Neroes vvaiters and ≈øeruice ≈øent by Nymphidius. But anone Vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, vvhich vvhollie po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed and gouerned the olde man, coun≈øailed him to put of popularity, as not be≈øeeming his place, to accept of Neroes proui≈øion, &amp; to become royall in expen≈øe and ≈øeruice. Verginius hauing deliuered the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to his ≈øucce≈ø≈øour met Galba on the waie, receiued of him not as in di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, and yet vvith ≈ømall honour ≈øo dangerous a point it is yea to haue but onelie refu≈øed the Empire.</p>
            <p>At Gellianus returne Nymphidius hearing that Laco was captaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, that Vinius had all the autoritie and credit, that his me≈ø≈øenger was ≈øu≈øpected and watched of all, not ≈øuffred to talke with the Prince in priuate, not once to approch to his per≈øon, was wonderfullie moued in minde. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a≈øsembling the chiefe of the Garde, he ≈øhewed them, that Galba was for his owne part a good harmele≈øse olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but mi≈ø≈øe-led by two per≈øons much of Tigellinus making, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>inius and Laco: and therefore it vvere not ami≈ø≈øe to

This ≈øpeech ≈øeeming ≈øtrange and ab≈øurde to pre≈øcribe to a Prince of tho≈øe yeares, as it were to an infant, his coun≈øaile &amp; ≈øeruantes, he taketh a contrarie cour≈øe, and writeth to Galba in terrifying maner, That the matters at Rome were doubtfull and dangerous, that Macer in Africke had ≈øtaied the ≈øhippes, the Legions of Germanie ≈øtirred a new, the like was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Iewrie and Syria. But perceiuing that Galba gaue to his tales ≈ømall eare and le≈ø≈øe credit, and hauing the ≈øouldiers all well affected, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to preuent and giue the attempt, notwith≈øtanding that Clodius Cel≈øus a ≈øober wi≈øe man and one of his frendes plainelie prote≈øted, that in his opinion ≈øcarce anie three per≈øons in Rome would accept him for Emperour: but the re≈øt skoffed it out, namelie one Mithridates of Pontus, Perhaps, quoth hee, Galba ≈øeemes ≈øome bodie now to the Romans, while≈øt he is ab≈øent: but when they ≈øhall ≈øee that balde head, and riueled face, hee vvill ≈øeeme the verie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and di≈øgrace of the daies in vvhich hee vvas Prince. And ≈øo they concluded at midnight following to bring Nymphidius into the campe and proclaime him Emperour. But vvhen the euening vvas come Antonius Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus a principall Tribune a≈øsembling the ≈øouldiers vnder his charge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vvhat euill ≈øpirit had bereaued them of vnder≈øtanding, moouing them ≈øo ≈øodainlie and vvithout cau≈øe to change their allegeance. If Nero de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerued it, vvhat mother, vvhat vvife, had Galba then killed? or for what mi≈ødemeanour would they for≈øake Seruius Galba to preferre a curtizans ≈øonne? with who≈øe bloud they ≈øhouldere it were long if they would bee dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by him, both reuenge Neroes death, whom hee fir≈øt betraied, and ≈øhewe them≈øelues loyall to Galba again≈øt whom he intendeth: willing them lastlie to recken in rea≈øon what ≈øucce≈ø≈øe might ten thou≈øand attende again≈øt the con≈øent of the Empire armed for Galba. His ≈øouldiers thus being per≈øuaded, per≈øuaded the re≈øt all in a maner to remaine in Galbaes obedience. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a ≈øhowte being made in the campe, Nymphidius ≈øuppo≈øing the ≈øouldiers had called him, or hasting to confirme the wauering, and preuent the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, went thither him≈øelfe with torches and linckes, hauing learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke an oration compo≈øed by Cingonius <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>arro, to pronounce there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them. But finding the gates of the campe made fast, and ≈øouldiers in armes on the walles, he ≈øeared the matter, and drawing neare demanded what they ment, and by who≈øe warrant they had put them≈øelues ≈øo in armes. and vvhen it vvas an≈øwered by all agreeablie, that they knew not, nor would not accept other Prince be≈øide Galba, Nymphidius finding the perill ioyned vvith them and vvi≈øhed al≈øo long life and pro≈øperitie to Galba

And ≈øo by the ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which garded the gates, being admitted with a fewe of his traine, he was at his entrie vvelcomed in with a dart hurled at him, which one Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius bare of vvith a buckler. But ≈øeeing ≈øo manie at the receit vvith naked ≈øwordes prepared again≈øt him, hee fled, &amp; being pur≈øued was ≈ølaine at the length in a ≈øouldiers cabin. The daie following his bodie was layed out to view in an open place rayled about.</p>
            <p>Galba being yet in his waie &amp; hearing of Nymphidius death comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the re≈øt of his fauourers and complices to be executed: among which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates of Pontus paied for his mirth, and Cingonius <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>arro vvho penned the oration. As Galba drew neare to the Cittie at the Miluian bridge the Mariners met him, vvhom, being by Nero taken from ≈øeruice by ≈øea, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled into a Legion, Galba had comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded to returne to their former e≈øtate. But they being many in number, &amp; loth to goe backe to the galleyes againe, be≈øet the hye waie on both ≈øides, demanding their Eagle &amp; en≈øeignes tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouslie, and ≈øo without order, that the Prince could neither bee heard nor ≈øeene of the people making his entrie: neither could he appea≈øe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> by putting them ouer to another time of greater lei≈øure and better audience, but taking differring as a kinde of denying, ≈øeditiou≈øly they murmured &amp; followed with outcries. And ≈øome of them al≈øo drew out their ≈øwords, as though they would obteine it by force, which by faire meanes they could not. Whereupon Galba commanding the hor≈øemen to ride in among≈øt them ≈ølew of them being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed ≈øeuen thou≈øand, and of the re≈øidue alotted euery tenth man to ≈øuffer, putting the re≈øt clo≈øe vp in pri≈øon, which neuerthe≈ø≈øe hee after enlarged to his di≈øaduantage.</p>
            <p>Now Galba, being vvith generall applau≈øe and great good liking of the Empire placed in ≈øtate, behaued him≈øelfe vnder expectation. And though in mo≈øt points he ≈øhewed him≈øelfe a vertuous Prince, yet vvere not his vvell doings ≈øo vvell accepted, as tho≈øe di≈øallowed vvhich vvere otherwi≈øe. All per≈øons vniu≈øtlie exiled by Nero, as well of the nobilitie as meaner ≈øort, vvith their children he mercifullie restored againe to their cuntrey and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though not to their vvealth. Contrarilie Petronius Turpilianus, an ancient man and once Con≈øull, vvithout forme of proce≈ø≈øe or order of law, he commanded to die, being charged vvith no other crime, but onelie that hee had bene faithfull to Nero and vvould not betraie him as the rest did. Then vvas repre≈øented a plau≈øible and gratefull ≈øpectacle, Elius, Polycletus, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custa, Patrobius, Petinus and others in fetters drawen thorow the Cittie and publicklie executed, as mini≈øters of Nero in mi≈øchieffes, vvhereas Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellinns the Master, not without notable incongruitie, was by Galba pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.

But that which was mo≈øt materiall of all, and prepared the way to his fall, was his hardne≈ø≈øe towardes the ≈øoldiers: to whom large donatiue being promi≈øed in Galbaes name, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quiring if not ≈øo much, yet ≈øo much at lea≈øt as they were wont to receiue, he wholly refu≈øed the ≈øuite, adding withal, That ≈øoldiers he tooke vp in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, bought not in the market. A ≈øaying no doubt fit for a great Prince in a more vetuous age, but not ≈øo in tho≈øe ≈øea≈øons for him, who ≈øuffered him≈øelfe to be ≈øolde euerie howre, and abu≈øed to al purpo≈øes; to be gouerned by three peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>inius &amp; Laco his fauourites, &amp; Jcelus his man. To priuate men it is ≈øufficient if them≈øelues do no wrong: a Prince mu≈øt prouide that none doe it about him; or els he may looke when the fir≈øt occa≈øion is offred again≈øt him to be charged with all the whole reckening togither. To him that ≈øuffereth the iniurie, it matters not much who made the motion when he feeleth the hand that is heauy vpon him. Thus Galba though innocent of much harme which pa≈ø≈øed vnder his name, yet becau≈øe he permitted them to commit it, whom he ought to haue brideled, or was ignorant of that which he ought to haue knowen, lo≈øt reputation, and opened the way to his owne de≈øtruction.</p>

                  <p>SOME few daies after the beginning of Ianuary, letters came out of Belgica from Pompeius Propinquus Procurator there, that the legions of vpper Germany without re≈øpect of oth and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty demanded another Emperour; and that this their reuolt might be the le≈ø≈øe hainou≈øly taken, had referred the choi≈øe thereof to the Senate, and people of Rome. The≈øe news ha≈øtned the purpo≈øe of Galba, who had already a good while before deui≈øed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and with ≈øome near about him, concerning the adoption. No ≈øpeech was for the time more common and curraunt in the whole city, partly vpon a licence and lu≈øt to talke of ≈øuch matters, and partly becau≈øe Galba was ≈øpent and feeble for age: vpon iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or loue to the commonwealth very few, the mo≈øt part vpon ≈øecret hopes, as they fauored or followed this man or that, offred occa≈øion to bring them in ≈øpeech for the ≈øucce≈øsion. And now Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius was grown into great hatred; who, as hee waxed daily more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18156:17"/> mighty, ≈øo daily more odious: for Galba with his too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie encrea≈øed and nouri≈øhed the greedy and gaping de≈øires of his friendes neuer ≈øatisfied in ≈øo greate meanes, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as vnder a Prince weake of body, and light of beleefe, with le≈ø≈øe feare, and greater aduantage. The whole power of the Prince was diuided betweene Titus Vinius the Con≈øul, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Laco captaine of the garde. Neither was Icelus the freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inferiour in fauour with his ma≈øter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> who being priuiledged to weare gold rings, &amp; made a gentleman, was commonly called by the name of Martianus. The≈øe three, otherwi≈øe di≈øagreeing, and in points of le≈ø≈øe importance drawing euery one a ≈øundry waie, in this con≈øultation of chu≈øing a ≈øucce≈ø≈øour were diuided into two ≈øides. Vinius was for Marcus Otho: Laco and Icelus agreed not ≈øo much vpon any one, as vpon any other. Neither did Galba much like of the party, ≈øu≈øpecting the coun≈øell of Vinius as partiall, and grounded vpon a mariage pretended betweene<note n="*" place="margin">Cri≈øpina.</note> his daughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a widowr, and Otho an vnmaried man; a matter wherewith the ears of the prince, by rea≈øon oftalecariers in court, were not vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.

For when word was brought thither of the ouerthrow, the ≈øouldiers reiected the newes as fal≈øe: and ≈øuppo≈øing the Senate to be enemy to Otho, they ob≈øerued their ≈øpeeches, interpreting their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, and externall behauiour to the wor≈øt; not ab≈øtaining at the la≈øt from reuiling, and contumelious termes, and apparently ≈øeeking an occa≈øion to begin a ma≈ø≈øacre: whereas the Senatours had be≈øide to ≈øtande in feare another way, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øeeme not forward enough to like of Vitellius victory, with whome now all the world was gone.

Lucceius Albinus was by Nero ≈øet ouer Mauretania Cae≈øarien≈øis, and Galba annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the admini≈øtration of Tingitana; ≈øo that he had forces of good moment vnder his charge: 18. cohorts, fiue wings, and an infinite number of Moores not vnfit for the warre, as men that v≈øually li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of ≈øtealing &amp; harrowing their neighbours. When Galba was ≈ølaine he followed the party of Otho, and not contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe with Africke, had a purpo≈øe for Spaine, being di≈øioyned from it by a narrow ≈øtrayte. Hereupon Cluvius Rufus was afraide, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>manded the tenth Legion to aproach to the ≈øhoare, as if he ment to haue ≈øhipped ouer: ≈øending before certaine Centurions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the mindes of the Moores to fauour Vitellius: neither was it harde to effect.

Nowe Vitellius vpon the comming of his brother, &amp; certaine ≈øchoolema≈øters of tyranny creeping into the court, waxing prowder &amp; fiercer, commanded Dolabella, whom, as before we remembred, Otho had confined to Aquinum, vpon this occa≈øion to be ≈ølaine. Dolabella, hearing that Otho was dead, was returned to Rome: whereof Plautius Varus once Praetor, one of Dolabellaes mo≈øt inward friendes, accu≈øed him before Flauius Sabinus the Prouo≈øt of the city, as if he had broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> pri≈øon, to the end to make offer of him≈øelfe for a head to the conquered faction: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moreouer, that to that purpo≈øe he had felt the cohort, which was in garri≈øon at O≈øtia: but hauing no one proofe of any of the≈øe ≈øo great crimes, he began to repent of his wicked deede, &amp; ≈øought pardon, but too late, after the facte. As Flauius Sabinus was in doubt how to proceede, in a matter of that wayght, Triaria the wife of Lucius Vitellius, fierce and cruell aboue the ordinary of that ≈øexe, terrified him; warning him not to affect the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of clemency by the perill of his Prince. Sabinus a man of his owne nature of a milde di≈øpo≈øition, but when hee was put in a feare ea≈øie to be changed, and fearing to make another mans danger his owne, le≈øt he ≈øhoulde ≈øeeme to haue helped him vp, as hee was falling pu≈øhed him forwarde. So Vitellius, partly vppon feare, and partly vpon an olde grudge, becau≈øe Dolabella had taken Petronia to wife ≈øtraight vpon hir deuorce from him, called him by letters to him: and commanding to auoide the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Flaminian way, and carry him by Interamna, he gaue commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to murther him there. that ≈øeemed too long to him who had the commis≈øion: &amp; therefore in an inne by the way, as Dolabella re≈øted him≈øelfe on the grounde, he cut his throat, to the great infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the new gouernment, wherof this was the fir≈øt proofe.

                  <p>Of all matters pre≈øent that vexed Vitellius mo≈øt, to ≈øee the vanqui≈øhed Legions retaine their ≈øtomackes vnuanqui≈øht: being di≈øper≈øed thorow Italie together with the winners, in all ≈øpeeches they ≈øhewed them≈øelues affected as enemies, and namely the fourteenth Legion; who caried the greate≈øt ≈øtomacke of them all, denying that euer they were ouercome: that in the battell at Bebriacum the Vexillaries onely were put to flight, the ≈øtrength of the Legion being not pre≈øent.

Alexander the gouernour of Aegypt had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the confederacy. The third Legion, becau≈øe it was tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred out of Syria into Moe≈øia, Ve≈øpa≈øian reckened as his owne: and the re≈øt of the Illyrian Legions it was hoped would folow.

                  <p>WHILEST the≈øe things were a working in the prouinces, by Ve≈øpa≈øian and his adherents, Vitellius growing euery day more contemptible and ≈ølothfull, ≈øtaying vpon euery place of plea≈øure in towne and country, with his trouble≈øome traine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched toward the citty.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Three≈øcore thou≈øand armed men were in the company licentiou≈øly giuen, of lackeyes and hor≈øekeepers a greater number; with infinite vittailers and followers of the campe, the mo≈øt di≈ø≈øolute of all others: be≈øide the traines of ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lieutenants and ≈øo many friendes, out of all compa≈ø≈øe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yea although the gouernours had beene men of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity and ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe. Moreouer the Senatours and gentlemen charged the traine, who came out of the citty to meete him, ≈øome for feare, ≈øome for flattery, the re≈øt and ≈øo all one after another for company, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øeeme to ≈øtay behinde when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did goe. Thither re≈øorted al≈øo of the ba≈øer ≈øort certaine well knowen to Vitellius by meanes of vnhone≈øt ≈øeruices, which in time pa≈øt they had done him, as buffons, ≈øtage players and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret driuers; with which kinde of reprochfull acquaintance he was delited wonderfully. Neither were the colonies onely or free townes impoueri≈øhed by purueying of vittailes for ≈øo huge a company; but the husbandmen them≈øelues, &amp; fieldes, the corne being now ripe, were ≈øpoiled and wa≈øted as an enemie countrey. Many and cruell murders were committed by the ≈øouldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them≈øelues, by rea≈øon of the iarring which continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Legions and Aydes, euer ≈øince the ≈øturre at Ticinum: again≈øt the pezantes, or any third party they agreed but too well:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18156:61"/> but the greate≈øt ≈ølaughter was ≈øeuen miles from the citty. At that place Vitellius di≈øtributed to his ≈øouldiers, according to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> fencers diet, to euery of them meate already dre≈ø≈øed: and the common people, that came out of the citty to ≈øee it, had di≈øper≈øed them≈øelues throughout the whole campe. As the ≈øoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers gaue no heede to ≈øuch matters, certaine plea≈øants, after a kind of homely ie≈øting, cut away ≈øecretly their belts, and ≈øpoiled them thereof; asking in jybing maner, whether they were girded or no. The ≈øoldiers ≈øtomacke, not v≈øed to beare words of di≈øgrace, could not di≈øge≈øt that ≈øcorne: but with their ≈øwordes reuenged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues vpon the people which was without weapon: among others the father of one of the ≈øouldiers was ≈ølaine as hee accompanied his ≈øonne: vpon which accident perceiued and noi≈øed abroad they refrained from ≈øhedding of innocent bloud. Notwith≈øtanding in Rome the terrour was great, by rea≈øon of the ≈øouldiers running and gadding thither before. The Place of common a≈ø≈øembly they repaired ≈øpecially to, coueting to behold the place where Galba was ≈ølaine: whenas they them≈øelues were a ≈øpectacle no le≈ø≈øe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, with hides of wilde bea≈øts about their backes, &amp; huge ma≈ø≈øy iauelins in their handes, falling to quarrelling, and from quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to blowes and their weapon, whenas thorough their owne lacke of skill they did not auoide the pre≈ø≈øe of the people, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fall by meanes of the ≈ølippery ≈øtones, or iu≈øtling of others. The Tribunes al≈øo and other captaines in terrible ≈øort, with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of armed men, went ≈øquaring and ietting the ≈øtreetes.

Moreouer the citty-≈øouldiery was through vndi≈øcreetne≈ø≈øe or ambition corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Sixteene Praetorian cohorts and foure vrban were enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, containing a thou≈øand men a piece. In preferring to tho≈øe roomes Valens pre≈øumed to beare greater ≈øtroake, as being the worthier man, and hauing redeemed Caecina him≈øelfe out of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill: and in trueth by his comming the ≈øide was reuiued, and with ≈øo happy a battell he cancelled the hard opinion of his ≈ølow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forward: and all the ≈øouldiers of lowe Germanie followed Valens and depended wholly vpon him: vpon which cau≈øes it is ≈øuppo≈øed that Caecinaes faith beganne fir≈øt to be fleeting. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding Vitellius yeelded not ≈øo much to the captaines, but that he yeelded much more to the ≈øouldiers plea≈øures: euery one cho≈øe his owne place of ≈øeruice: were he neuer ≈øo vnworthy, if he liked it better hee was deputed to the citty ≈øeruice: againe tho≈øe which were fit were ≈øuffered, if they li≈øted to remaine in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer e≈øtate among the Legionary or Auxiliary ≈øoldiers: which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øe were willing to doe being mole≈øted with ≈øickne≈ø≈øes, and not able to endure the heat of the countrey. Notwith≈øtanding the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Aydes were drawen of their principall ≈øtrength, and the beauty of the Praetorian campe blemi≈øhed, by this confu≈øion rather then choi≈øe of twenty thou≈øand out of the whole army. As Vitellius was making a ≈øolemne ≈øpeech, the ≈øouldiers required A≈øiaticus, and Flauius, and Rufinus, captaines of France to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, becau≈øe they had taken armes in Vindex behalfe: neither did Vitellius re≈øtraine ≈øuch ≈øpeeches, be≈øides that he was a man of weake re≈øi≈øtance by nature, knowing al≈øo that the day of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue was at hand, and the money wanting. Wherefore he granted liberally all other reque≈øts to the ≈øouldier: and to ≈øupply that defect the freedmen of the former Princes were commanded to contribute, according to the number of their bondmen: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Vitellius without other care, ≈øaue onely to wa≈øt and con≈øume, builded vp ≈øtables for charet driuers, filled the Race with ≈øpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of fencers and wilde bea≈øtes, and as in greate≈øt abundaunce

                  <p>THE reuolt of the third Legion was fir≈øt of all other certefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Vitellius by letters, written by Aponius Saturninus, before that he al≈øo a≈ø≈øociated him≈øelfe to Ve≈øpa≈øians ≈øide. But neither did Aponius write all, as a man afrighted with the ≈øodainne≈ø≈øe thereof, and be≈øide the frendes of Vitellius flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ≈øought to extenuate and le≈ø≈øen the matter: that it was but a mutince of one Legion alone; a matter of noe moment, ≈øeeing all other armies remained in obedience. After the ≈øame ≈øtile Vitellius al≈øo ≈øpake to the ≈øoldiers, inueying again≈øt the lately ca≈ø≈øed Praetorians, by whome hee affirmed fal≈øe rumours were ≈øpred, and that there was no danger of ciuill warre, ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing the name of Ve≈øpa≈øian, and ≈øetting vnderhand ≈øouldiers abroad
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18156:63"/> in the towne to re≈øtraine the ≈øpeeches of the common people: which thing was a principall meanes to nouri≈øh the fame. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthele≈ø≈øe he ≈øent for Aydes out of Germanie and Britannie, and the Spaines, coldly and di≈ø≈øembling the neces≈øity: the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and prouinces on their partes v≈øed the like coldne≈ø≈øe againe. Hordeonius Flaccus Lieutenant of Germanie ≈øu≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting already the reuolt of Batauia, had a warre of his own to care and prouide for. Vectius Bolanus gouerned in Britannie, a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey neuer ≈øo in quiet, that hee could conueniently ≈øpare any number of ≈øouldiers: and be≈øide neither of them were greatly fa≈øt to the ≈øide. Out of the Spaines al≈øo ≈ømall ha≈øt was made: at that time there was no Lieutenant generall there, but onely the Lieutenants of three Legions, of equall autoritie; who as in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius pro≈øperity they would haue contended who ≈øhould haue bene formo≈øt, ≈øo now in his declining e≈øtate they equally drew backe. In Africke the Legion and cohorts leuyed by Clodius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and ≈øtraightwaies di≈ømi≈ø≈øed by Galba, beganne by Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius commaundement to re≈øume their ≈øeruice againe: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the whole youth of the prouince voluntarily gaue in their names to be ≈øouldiers: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> Vitellius had gouerned as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øull there with good integrity and liking, Ve≈øpa≈øian with as much infamie and hatred of the cuntrey; and accordingly our allies pre≈øumed, they would cary them≈øelues in the Empire: but the triall was otherwi≈øe. And at the beginning Valerius Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtus the Lieutenant furthered faithfully the endeuours of tho≈øe of the prouince: but anone he faultred, in letters and edicts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly pretending Vitellius, and with ≈øecrete me≈ø≈øages intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ve≈øpa≈øian; meaning to defende the one ≈øide, or the other, according as they ≈øhould happen to pro≈øper. Some Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ≈øouldiers were taken in Rhoetia and France with letters and edicts of Ve≈øpa≈øian about them, and being ≈øent to Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us were ≈ølaine: but more e≈øcaped pas≈øing vndi≈øcouered by the ≈øecretne≈ø≈øe of frendes, or by their owne ≈øhifting. So the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Vitellius were knowen abroade: Ve≈øpa≈øians purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes were for the mo≈øt part vnknowen, partly through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Vitellius, and partly becau≈øe the Pannonian Alpes were kept with garri≈øon, which ≈øtayed all me≈ø≈øengers: and at ≈øea the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> Ete≈øians blew, a good wind to ≈øaile ea≈øtward, and contrary from thence.</p>

                  <p>AT length Vitellius terrified with the breaking in of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vpon the frontiers of Italie, and feareful me≈ø≈øages from euery quarter, commandeth Caecina and Valens to make ready for the warre. Caecina was ≈øent before, but Valens ≈øtayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde by rea≈øon of his weakne≈ø≈øe in body, being lately recouered of a dangerous ≈øickne≈ø≈øe. Nowe the German army going out of the citty made a farre other ≈øhew then it did at the entry. No quickne≈ø≈øe appeared in their bodies, no courage in their mindes; marching ≈ølowly and thinnely: the armour decayed, the hor≈øes vnlu≈øty: the ≈øouldier impatient of the ≈øunne, the du≈øt, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the more dull to ≈øu≈øtaine trauell, the apter to mutin. And be≈øide, the qualities of Caecina wrought no ≈ømall preiudice to the cau≈øe: his ambitious and populare proceeding, an old fault of his: a ≈øluggi≈øh and dull di≈øpo≈øition, lately ≈øprung vp: whether it were that too much fauour of fortune turned his edge &amp; cau≈øed him to degenerat to riotous life, or that intending euen then trea≈øon in his minde, he thought it good pollicy by that meanes to weaken the valure and force of the army. Many haue beleeued that Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes minde was ≈øhaken and altered fir≈øt by a practi≈øe of<note n="a" place="margin">Brother to <hi>Ve≈øpa≈øian</hi> and Prouo≈øt of Rome.</note> Flauius Sabinus, Rubrius Gallus carying the me≈ø≈øage between them, and promi≈øing that Ve≈øpa≈øian ≈øhould ratify all couenants made and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in ca≈øe of reuolt: and withall he was put in remembrance of the hatred and emulation betweene Valens and him, and that ≈øeeing he had not like part in Vitellius, he ≈øhould doe wi≈øely to purcha≈øe credit and might with the new Prince.

When Caecina was gone, Fabius Valens wrote to the army, which before belonged to his charge, to ≈øtay for him in the way: that ≈øo it was agreed betweene him and Caecina: who being pre≈øent, and therefore of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18156:64"/> greater autority, fal≈øely alledged, that vpon later adui≈øe that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe was changed, to the end that re≈øi≈øtance might be made with the whole forces vnited again≈øt the enemies comming. So the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were commanded to make ≈øpeede to Cremona, and part to go to Ho≈øtilia. Caecina him≈øelfe turned out of the way to Rauenna, vpon pretence to giue direction to the nauy: and ≈øo to Padoua, where ≈øecretly the trea≈øon was contriued betweene Lucilius Ba≈ø≈øus and him. For Lucilius Ba≈ø≈øus after the captaine≈øhippe of a wing, being made Admirall of both the fleets at Rauenna and Mi≈øenum, becau≈øe he was not by and by created captaine of the Garde, reuenged his vniu≈øt anger with wicked di≈øloyalty: neither can it be certainly knowen, whether he drew Caecina into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the ≈øame vile minde induced them both, as it happeneth often lewde per≈øons to be of like conditions. The hi≈øtories writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this warre, vnder Ve≈øpa≈øian and his children, haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered fal≈øe and flattering cau≈øes, as that de≈øire of peace and loue of the common wealth moued them thereto. To me it ≈øeemeth, be≈øide the incon≈øtant di≈øpo≈øition of the men, and the ≈ømall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their faith, which once being fal≈øed to Galba, afterward they neuer re≈øpected; that vpon emulation and enuy that others ≈øhould goe before them in the Princes fauour, they compa≈ø≈øed the de≈øtruction of the Prince him≈øelfe.

There ≈øome fewe daies were ≈øpent in repo≈øing the army, and Minucius Iu≈øtus campe-ma≈øter of the ≈øeuenth Legion was ≈øaued from the fury of the ≈øoldier, and ≈øent to Ve≈øpa≈øian, becau≈øe his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement was ≈øtraiter and more ≈øeuere, then the nature of a ciuill warre would ≈øupport. At what time al≈øo Antonius ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing it a plau≈øible action, and for the credit of the ≈øide, if Galbaes gouernment ≈øhould ≈øeeme to be liked, gaue commandement tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out all the free townes, that the images of Galba, which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on change of times and di≈ø≈øen≈øion in ≈øtate, had beene broken downe, ≈øhould be re≈øtored a new: a thing very long and greatlie de≈øired, and therefore interpreted gloriou≈øly in the highe≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Then was it propo≈øed and di≈øputed, what place were be≈øt to be cho≈øen, for ≈øeate as it were of the warre. Verona ≈øeemed fitte≈øt, the countrey about it being champion, and commodious for hor≈øemen, wherein con≈øi≈øted their principall ≈øtrength: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe Vitellius of a towne of ≈øuch wealth and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, would both be commodious and bring reputation to the cau≈øe. In the pa≈ø≈øage thitherward they tooke Vicenza a thing of it ≈øelfe not greatly materiall, as being a towne of ≈ømal forces; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit becau≈øe Caecina was borne there it ≈øeemed a matter of con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; when men beganne to recount, how that the Generall of the contrary part had lo≈øt his owne countrey and home: but the getting of Verona was worth the paines taking. For both the ≈øide was relieued with their wealth, and the example was a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to others: and the army lying there opportunely in the way, betweene Germanie and Vitellius powers, did ≈øhut vp the Rhoetian and Iulian Alpes, and cut of all hope of pa≈ø≈øage for the Germanes that way. All which proceeding was either vnknowen to Ve≈øpa≈øian, or expre≈ø≈øely forbidden by him: his commandement was to march no further then Aquileia, and there to expect Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus; adding al≈øo a rea≈øon thereof, that ≈øeing Aegypt, the garners of the citty, the reuenues and tributes of the riche≈øt prouinces were in his hands, Vitellius army might through lacke of pay and vittaile be con≈øtrained to yeelde.

Anone Caecina encamped him≈øelfe between Ho≈øtilia, a village of the territorie of Verona, and the mari≈øhes of the riuer Tartarus, in a ≈øafe and defen≈øible place; his backe being garded with the riuer, and the flanckes with mari≈øhes: who if hee had meant trueth, hauing all his ma≈øters power vnder his hande, might with great facilitie either haue ≈øurprized two ≈øimple Legions (the army of Moe≈øia as yet being not ioyned) or at lea≈øt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them backe, and forced them to flee, and with ≈øhame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øake Italie. But Caecina omitted traiterou≈øly all aduantages, which at the fir≈øt were offered, ≈øpending the time in trifling delaies, and rebuking them by epi≈øtles, whome with like facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hee might haue repul≈øed with armes: vntill by me≈ø≈øengers pa≈øsing betweene the bargaine was driuen, and the couenantes for his trea≈øon agreed vpon. In the meane time Aponius Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus came with the ≈øeuenth Legion ≈øurnamed Claudiana: the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was gouerned by Vip≈øanius Me≈ø≈øalla a Tribune, a man nobly de≈øcended, and of noble qualities him≈øelfe, the only vertuous man and without note, that entred into that action. To this army, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to his owne (for as yet there were but three Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions) Caecina ≈øent letters, blaming their ra≈øhnes, that being once ouercome they dur≈øt put them≈øelues againe into armes: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he extolled the valure of the German army; of Vitellius making ≈ømall mention and in common termes only, without any reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worde again≈øt Ve≈øpa≈øian at all: in ≈øumme writing nothing that might either corrupt the enemie or terrifie him.

Lucilius Ba≈ø≈øus, Admiral of the nauy at Rauenna, had wunne to the Flauian ≈øide the mindes of his ≈øoldiers, being ≈øomewhat inclinable thereto of them≈øelues, becau≈øe the mo≈øt of them were of Dalmatia and Pannonia, which cuntreyes held for Ve≈øpa≈øian.

Ba≈ø≈øus either for ≈øhame, or doubt what would be the i≈ø≈øue, kept him≈øelfe within his hou≈øe.

                  <p>WHEN Antonius had vnder≈øtanding hereof, he determined while≈øt the enemies were at di≈ø≈øen≈øion, and their forces not ioyned together, to v≈øe his aduantage and a≈ø≈øaile them, before either the Generals could ground their autority, or the ≈øouldiers

So with his whole ho≈øt he remoued from Verona, and the ≈øeconde night ≈øate downe at Bebriacum. The next day imploying his Legions in fortifying the campe, he ≈øent out his Auxiliary cohorts into the territory of Cremona, to the ende that the ≈øouldiers, vnder coulour of prouiding nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, might be enured and fle≈øhed<note n="a" place="margin">That is, in ≈øpoiles grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by rea≈øon of ciuil warres</note> in ciuill ≈øpoile.

While≈øt Antonius was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating what was to be done, Arius Varus, de≈øirous to doe ≈øome piece of ≈øeruice, brake out with certaine of the forwarde≈øt hor≈øemen, &amp; made the Vitelliani≈øts recule, and ≈ølew ≈øome few: for by and by more of their fellowes comming to helpe, fortune changed, and they that were mo≈øt forward before in pur≈øuing, were now left la≈øt in the flight. This ha≈øt was again≈øt Antonius will, who ≈øuppo≈øed the euent would be ≈øuch as it was: but ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it coulde not bee vndone he encouraged his men to fight valiantly: and diuiding his troupes in two parts, left a lane in the midle to receiue in Varus with his hor≈øemen<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> worde al≈øo was ≈øent backe to the Legions to arme, and the alarme was giuen to tho≈øe that were forraging abroade, that euery man ≈øhould leaue of ≈øpoiling, and repaire with all ≈øpeede the next way to the fight.

About fower miles from Cremona, the en≈øeignes of two Legions, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pax and Italica, appeared, hauing marched ≈øo farre vpon the ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe of their hor≈øemen at the beginning: but when fortune tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they were ≈øo farre to ≈øeeke, as that they neither did open their ranckes, &amp; receiue their di≈øtre≈ø≈øed fellowes within them, nor yet went forwarde to a≈ø≈øayle the enemie tired already with fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and following ≈øo farre. Thus being by chance ouercome, they found in aduer≈øity the lacke of a leader, which in their iolity they cared not for. As the Legions ≈øtoode wauering in termes of breaking, the Flauian hor≈øemen charged vppon them: and Vip≈øanius Me≈ø≈øalla the Tribune was at their heeles with the Moe≈øian Aides, who in militare renowne, albeit lately enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, were nothing inferiour to the Legionary ≈øouldiers. So hor≈øemen and footemen mingled together did ea≈øilie breake the Vitellian Legions, and the towne of Cremona lying ≈øo neare gaue

The≈øe gay ≈øpeeches were in their mouthes and openly preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but ≈øecretely euery one ca≈øt thus with him≈øelfe; That a towne ≈øeated in the plaine might be wunne ea≈øily at a pu≈øh; that their courage would as well ≈øerue them to enter in the night, and their liberty to ≈øpoile would then be much greater: but if they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till day, then would there come ≈øupplications and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for peace, and ≈øo for their labour and hurts they ≈øhould ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the vaine ≈ømokes of clemencie and glory, and ≈øuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther titulare matters, but the wealth and riches of the towne would cleaue to the captaines and Lieutenants fingers: that the ≈øpoile of a citty taken by force fell to the ≈øouldiers, but of a citty ≈øurrendred alwaies to the captaines alone. Hereupon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions of the Tribunes &amp; Centurions, as per≈øons ≈øu≈øpect, were reiected: and becau≈øe no mans ≈øpeech ≈øhould be heard, they rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their weapons, threatening if no man would lead them be≈øide, to guide &amp; conduct them≈øelues. Then Antonius in≈øinuating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe among the common ≈øoldiers, after he had with the ≈øight of his per≈øon, &amp; reuerence of his place, procured ≈øilence, prote≈øted vnto them, that his meaning was not in any ≈øort to defraude ≈øo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeruing ≈øoldiers, either of honour or reward<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> notwith≈øtanding the captaines and ≈øoldiers duties were of different nature: a ≈øouldier ought to be fierce and de≈øirous to fight, but in captaines a wary fore≈øight &amp; deliberate kind of proceeding is rather commended<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and more often times profiteth and helpeth hee by protracting, then venturing ra≈øhly.

At which breach as the ≈øeuenth Legion a≈ø≈øaied to enter, in a pointed battell, the third Legion in the meane ≈øea≈øon brake downe the gate with their ≈øwords and axes. It is agreed vpon by al writers, that the fir≈øt man which entred the trench was Caius Volu≈øius, a ≈øouldier of the third Legion, who pre≈øently going to the rampier tumbled downe all that re≈øi≈øted, and aduauncing him≈øelfe in ≈øight proclaimed the campe was taken: and as the Vitelliani≈øts were now beginning to faint, and leape downe from the rampier, the re≈øt brake in. All the ≈øpace betweene the trenches and the towne was filled with deade bodies. And there againe appeared a new worke, and another la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: the walles of the citty were high, the towers all of ≈øtone, the barres of the gates of iron, the ≈øouldier ready with weapon in hande on the walles, the towne≈ømen manie and ≈øure to Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us; be≈øide a great number of ≈øtrangers a≈ø≈øembled out of al places of Italie thither, by occa≈øion of a faire v≈øually holden there at
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18156:74"/> that time. But that as it was a helpe to the defendants in re≈øpect of the multitude, ≈øo was it a prouocation to the a≈ø≈øailants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of the ≈øpoile. Antonius commanded to take fire and burne certaine mo≈øt goodly buildings, ≈øtanding without the walles, if peraduenture the towne≈ømen vpon the lo≈ø≈øe of their ≈øub≈øtaunce would be induced to yeelde. The hou≈øes that were neare to the walles, and exceeded them in height, he repleni≈øhed with the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante≈øt ≈øoldiers he had; who with blockes of timber, &amp; tiles, &amp; fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandes, bet away the defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts from the walles: by this time al≈øo, the Legions had ca≈øt them≈øelues into a target fence, &amp; others ≈øhot ≈øtones, &amp; arowes again≈øt them on the walles. Then the Vitelliani≈øts hartes beganne by little and little to faile them, and euery man as he was fir≈øt in degree was likewi≈øe the fir≈øt to yeelde vnto fortune, le≈øt if Cremona al≈øo ≈øhould be taken there would bee no hope of pardon remaining, the whole wrath of the winners being like to turne not vpon the poore and beggerly ≈øouldier, but vpon the Tribunes and Centurions, by who≈øe death ≈øome gaine might be gotten: contrarily the common ≈øoldier not ≈øearching into ≈øequels, and in le≈ø≈øe danger by rea≈øon of his ba≈øene≈ø≈øe, per≈øi≈øted ≈øtil for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius: and wandring in the ≈øtreetes, or hiding them≈øelues in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes would not ≈øue for peace, euen then whenas they had left off to make warre. So the principall men of degree in the army razed Vitellius name, and defaced his images, and loo≈øing Caecina, who then was in bandes, de≈øired him to become interce≈ø≈øour in their behalfe. As he made dainty to doe it, and bare him≈øelfe proudly again≈øt them, they be≈øought him in≈øtantly euen with teares (a mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all mi≈øeries, ≈øo many valiant men to implore the aide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of a di≈ødainfull traitour) and then hung out ouer the walles their<note n="*" place="margin">Velamenta &amp; infulat.</note> ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred veles and infules, in ≈øigne of ≈øubmi≈øsion. Whereupon Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius commaunding his men to ≈øurcea≈øe all ho≈øtility, they brought out their en≈øeignes and ≈øtanderds: the Vitellian Legions folowed; a heauy companie, vnarmed, and ca≈øting their eies to the ground. the Flauiani≈øts clo≈øed about them, and fir≈øt outraged them in ≈øpeeches, and ≈øeemed to threaten violence vnto them: but when they ≈øaw them not moued thereat, but patiently to endure all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, according to the circum≈øtance of their pre≈øent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they beganne to call to remembrance, that euen tho≈øe were the ≈øelfe≈øame men, that had a little before at Bebriacum v≈øed their victory moderately. But when Caecina came forth as a Con≈øull
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18156:74"/> in his robes, with his ≈øergeants before him making way thorow the pre≈ø≈øe, the conquering ≈øouldiers lo≈øt all maner of patience, obiecting vnto him his pride, and his cruelty; yea and his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon too: ≈øo hatefull are vices euen where they are profitable. But Antonius interpo≈øed him≈øelfe, and ≈øent him ≈øafely garded away to Ve≈øpa≈øian. In the meane ≈øea≈øon the people of the towne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ≈øo many armed men, were greatly annoyed, and they ≈øca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped nearely of a generall ma≈ø≈øacre, had not the captaines intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; ≈øomewhat appea≈øed the ≈øoldiers wrath. Antonius calling a ful a≈ø≈øembly made a ≈øolemne oration, ≈øpeaking in glorious termes to the ≈øoldiers of his own ≈øide, &amp; in curteous to tho≈øe of the other, concerning Cremona ambiguou≈øly. The army was doubtles ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly bent to the de≈øtruction and ≈øacke of the citty, be≈øide a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall de≈øire of ≈øpoile, vpon an olde conceaued di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt them: for in the warre of Otho al≈øo they were thought to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtedde and helped Vitellius ≈øide; and afterwardes the thirteenth Legion being left there to build an amphitheatre (as commonly the≈øe towne≈øme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> are naturally malapert) they had ie≈øted &amp; ≈øcoffed at them many other circum≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ces made their ca≈øe al≈øo the harder, as that Caecina had in that towne exhibited his ≈øhew of<note n="‚Äú" place="margin">Gladiatores</note> fencers in honour of Vitellius victory: that it was cho≈øen now the ≈øecond time for the ≈øeate-towne of the warre: that they had helped the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellian army with vittailes: that ≈øome women were found ≈ølaine, which for extreme loue to the ≈øide had come out to the battaile: and not lea≈øt becau≈øe the faire time had filled the towne, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe wealthy, with ≈øhew of more wealth. And thus ≈øtoode the ≈øoldiers for their part affected. As concerning the Commanders, the behauiours of the re≈øt were not much marked: Antonius by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øon of his fortune and his fame was principally eyed: who a≈ø≈øoone as he entred the towne went pre≈øently to the bath to wa≈øh of the bloud, &amp; finding it ≈øomewhat too coole, let fall a word which was quickly taken vp, that ere long it would be made hoater. This ba≈øe ie≈øt turned the whole blame vpon him, as if hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thereby a watchworde to ≈øet Cremona on fire, which to ≈øay the trueth was burning already. Forty thou≈øande armed men were broken in, and of ≈øeruants and followers of the campe both a greater number, and a great deale more di≈øordered in all kinde of licentious and cruell demeanour: neither age, nor honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calling could warrant any from violence, but without re≈øpect
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18156:75"/> of eyther they abu≈øed their bodies in villanous maner, and ≈ølew them indifferently. Aged men and olde women, nought worth to be ≈øolde, they haled in a iolity for pa≈øtime and ≈øporte: if any mayde of competent yeares, or bewtifull yongman fell among≈øt them, in ≈øtriuing who ≈øhould cary them away, they pulled them a≈øunder &amp; tare them in pieces; and thereupon growing in choler turned to kill one another. Whenas any had gotten and caryed away for him≈øelfe money, or the golde and iewels out of the temples, being met by a ≈øtronger, he left behinde him both his life and his bootie: ≈øome contemning that which they found ready and open, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the owners with torture and ≈øtripes, to confe≈ø≈øe and yeeld vp their hidden riches, and trea≈øures buried vnder the ground. The ≈øouldiers walked with firebrands in their handes, which a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoone as they had emptied the goods, they hurled in a ≈øporte and wantonne≈ø≈øe into the voyde hou≈øes, and empty temples. And as in an armie diuer≈øe in language and manners, compounded of Romans, confederates, and ≈øtrangers, their lu≈øts and de≈øires were diuer≈øe, and ≈øomething held lawfull by one, ≈øomething by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and nothing vnlawfull to all. Fower whole dayes Cremona mini≈øtred matter to ≈øacke and to burne: and all things be≈øide both holy &amp; prophane being con≈øumed into a≈øhes, the temple of<note n="a" place="margin">The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈ø≈øe of ill ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.</note> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitis without the walles remained vntouched, either becau≈øe it ≈øtoode out of the way, or by rea≈øon of ≈øome diuine vertue of the godde≈ø≈øe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> This end had the city of Cremona, two hundreth eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; ≈øix yeares after the foundation. It was built in the<note n="b" place="margin">In the yeare of the Citty 536. and the fir≈øt yeare of the ≈øecond <hi>Punicke</hi> warre</note> yeare that Tiberius Sempronius &amp; Publius Cornelius were Con≈øuls, when Hannibal was about to come into Italy, for a bulwarke again≈øt the Frenchmen beyond the Po, and if any other power ≈øhould breake in by the Alpes. So by rea≈øon of the number of inhabitants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of riuers, fertility of the ≈øoile annexed, &amp; affinities contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with other people, it grew vp &amp; flouri≈øhed, in forraine warres vntouched, vnfortunate in ciuill. Antonius a≈øhamed of this foule act, which daily grew more &amp; more odious, made proclamation, that no man ≈øhould keepe any cittizen of Cremona as his lawfull pri≈øoner: and all Italie with one generall con≈øent refu≈øing to buy any of them for ≈ølaues marred the ≈øoldiers market: who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon began to murther their pri≈øoners. Which being once know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, their frendes &amp; kinsfolkes ≈øecretly came &amp; ran≈øomed them. In ≈øhort time after the re≈øt of the people returned to Cremona. The
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18156:75"/> publicke places and temples were reedified at the charges of the towne≈ømen, and vpon Ve≈øpa≈øians ≈øpeciall encouragement. For the pre≈øent, the ground being infected with the noy≈øomene≈ø≈øe of the dead carca≈øes, ≈øuffered not the Flauian army to dwell long vpon the ruines of the razed citty. So they remooued three miles of, and there reduced the Vitelliani≈øts, being di≈øbanded, and trembling for feare, euery ≈øoldier vnder his colours, and anone afterward ≈øent them away into Illyricum, le≈øt during the time of the troubles they ≈øhould fortune to worke innouation.

And ≈øome per≈øwaded him to take a fewe of his tru≈øtie≈øt frendes, and ≈øo auoyding Rauenna by ≈øecrete bywayes to goe in all ≈øpeed to Ho≈øtilia, or Cremona: others were of opinion to ≈øende for the Praetorian cohorts out of the cittie, and ≈øo by ≈øtrong hande to make pa≈ø≈øage.

At the la≈øt through the in≈øtant reque≈øt of his armie lying in Meuania, with a great trayne of Senatours a≈ø≈øumed, partly vpon ≈øuite and mo≈øt vpon feare, he repayred to the campe irre≈øolute of him≈øelfe,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18156:82"/> and obnoxious to vnfaithfull coun≈øailes.

But the greate≈øt mon≈øter was Vitellius him≈øelfe, a Prince without skill in the profes≈øion of armes, and deuoyde of direction and coun≈øell, demanding eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoones of others in what order to march, what diligence was requi≈øite in making di≈øcoueries, what meane was to be ob≈øerued in vrging, or delaying the warre, and vpon euery flying report apparently fearefull in countenance, and trembling in gate, and be≈øide all this mo≈øt commonly druncken. At the length growing weary of the campe, and vnder≈øtanding of the reuolt of the nauy at Mi≈øenum, hee returned to Rome, euer fearing mo≈øt the blowe that came la≈øt, and carele≈ø≈øe in the meane time of the mayne chance.

But the nauy at Mi≈øenum (≈øo much the audaciou≈øne≈ø≈øe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of one ≈øingle man in ciuill di≈ø≈øen≈øions may work) was brought to reuolt by the meanes of Claudius Fauentinus, a Centurion ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiou≈øly ca≈ø≈øed by Galba, who counterfayting letters from Ve≈øpa≈øian, with hope of reward induced them to change their allegeance. The Admirall thereof was Claudius Apollinaris, a man that neither con≈øtantly kept his fidelity, nor ≈øtoutly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his trea≈øon: and Apinius Tiro, who had bene Pretor, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18156:82"/> was then by chance at Minturnae, offred him≈øelfe for a head to them which reuolted; by who≈øe meanes the colonies and free townes were drawen to the ≈øide, the Puteolani ≈øhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues mo≈øt forward that way. But Capua on the other ≈øide, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted firme to Vitellius: whereupon there pa≈ø≈øed, vnder coulour of the publicke cau≈øe, much priuate choler betweene the two townes. To the pacification of the≈øe troubles Vitellius cho≈øe out Claudius Iulianus (who had lately bene Admirall of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie at Mi≈øenum, and gouerned him≈øelfe in that charge with great mildne≈ø≈øe) as the meete≈øt man to appea≈øe the ≈øouldiers mindes; as≈øigning vnto him a power of one cittie-cohort, and the<note n="‚Äú" place="margin">Gladiatores</note> fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which were vnder his charge. A≈ø≈øoone as the campes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the one to the other, Iulianus without any great ≈øtay turned to Ve≈øpa≈øians ≈øide, and ≈øo iointly they tooke Tarracian, a place of great ≈øtrength in regarde of the walles and ≈øituation, if the men within had bene faithfull and good. Vpon knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Vitellius leauing part of his forces at Narnia, with the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of his Garde, ≈øent his brother Lucius Vitellius away with ≈øix cohorts and fiue hundreth hor≈øe, to manage the warre of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania. Him≈øelfe beeing greatly perplexed in minde was yet ≈øomewhat reuiued with the earne≈øt goodwill of the ≈øoldiers, and clamours of the towne people requiring armour and weapons; whom being nought els but a cowardly companie, who≈øe bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe neuer went beyonde wordes, he called by the fal≈øe title of armies and Legions. At the per≈øwa≈øion of his freedmen (for of his frendes the greate≈øt men were lea≈øt tru≈øty) he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the tribes to be called, and ≈øware them which gaue in their names: too many pre≈øenting them≈øelues, he diuided the charge of the mu≈øter betweene the two Con≈øuls, and a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours at a certaine number of bond-men, and quantity of ≈øil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The Gentlemen of Rome made offer both of their ≈øeruice and money, euen the Libertini requiring of their owne motion they might be admitted to doe al≈øo the like. This counterfayt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈ø≈øe made the offices, that were done for feare, be thought to proceede of goodwill. And indeede many pitied not ≈øo much the man, as the place he ≈øu≈øteined: &amp; Vitellius him≈øelfe cea≈øed not by his countenance, ≈øpeech &amp; teares to prouoke compa≈ø≈øion and pitty, promi≈øing largely, &amp; (as the nature is of men in great feare) without mea≈øure.

But in pas≈øing the Apennine the armie by the fowlene≈ø≈øe of the winter weather was greatly di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, and marching with all liberty and quietnes could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wre≈øtle out of the ≈ønowe, ≈øo that it was cleare to be ≈øeene, what danger they mu≈øt needes haue ≈øu≈øtayned, if fortune, to which the Flauian captaines were more often beholding, then to their good guiding and skill, had not turned Vitellius backe home againe. In the mountaines Petilius Cerealis met them, who in clowni≈øh apparell through knowledge of the countrey had e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped Vitellius handes. Cerealis was of neare affinity with Ve≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øian, &amp; of ≈øome name for matters of warre, and therefore was a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Leaders. Many write that Flauius Sabinus and Domitian might al≈øo haue ea≈øily e≈øcaped, and certaine it is, that diuer≈øe me≈ø≈øengers ≈øent by Antonius by ≈øundry cunning ≈øleights came to their ≈øpeech, pointing the place, and offring them meanes for their ≈øafety: but Sabinus alleadged that his crazy body was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18156:83"/> not to vndertake a matter of that paines, and ≈øuch an audacious attempt. Domitian would gladly haue ventured, but hee feared the keepers whom Vitellius had ≈øet about him, although they offred to accompany him in his e≈øcape, le≈øt peraduenture it had beene a ≈ønare to intrappe him: and indeede Vitellius him≈øelfe, in regarde of his owne kinsfolkes, intended no cruelty again≈øt Domitian. When the Flauian captaines were come to Car≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, they ≈øtaied there a fewe daies to repo≈øe their army, till their Legionary power ≈øhould ouertake them: and the place of the campe in it ≈øelfe was delitefull, with a large goodly pro≈øpect, and verie ≈øafe for the proui≈øion of vittailes, hauing ≈øo manie of the welthie≈øt citties, as it were ≈øtore hou≈øes behinde them. And be≈øides they were in ≈øome hope that the Vitelliani≈øts, which were not di≈øtant aboue tenne miles, would fall to ≈øome parle, and ≈øo from a parle to a reuolt: which thing the ≈øouldiers could not abide to heare of, but de≈øired an ende rather by conque≈øt, then by peace: euen their owne Legions they were vnwilling to ≈øtay for, loath to haue more fellowes in the ≈øpoile, when they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded none in the danger. But Antonius calling them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie together, ≈øhewed vnto them, that Vitellius had yet ≈øome forces remayning, wauering perhappes and vncon≈øtant if they might haue time to con≈øult, but of fierce ≈øtomacke if they were driuen to de≈øpaire: that the beginnings of ciuill warres were to bee permitted to fortunes deciding, but the accompli≈øhment of the victorie was to bee gouerned by rea≈øon and wi≈øedome: that the nauie of Mi≈øenum, and the mo≈øt flouri≈øhing countrey of Campania were alreadie reuolted, and there remayned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of al the world vnto Vitellius, ≈øaue onely ≈øo much as lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Tarracina and Narnia: and ≈øurely they had wunne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ≈øufficient in the battayle at Cremona, and blame too much by de≈øtroying the towne. therefore they ≈øhould not now de≈øire to take Rome, but rather to ≈øaue it: their rewarde would bee greater, and their glory mo≈øt great, if they wrought the ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Senate and people of Rome without bloud≈øhed.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18156:84"/> cornets vnto the conquerour, to purcha≈øe fauour hereafter; and gaue al≈øo aduerti≈øement, that fa≈øt thereby at Interamna was a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon of fower hundreth hor≈øe. Whereupon immediately Varus was di≈øpatched with a band of men lightly appointed, and ≈ølewe ≈øome fewe that made re≈øi≈øtance: but the mo≈øt part laide downe their weapons, and yeelded them≈øelues to his mercy: ≈øome fled to the campe at Narnia, and filled all there full of feare and terror, extolling aboue trueth the forces and valour of the enemies, to dimini≈øh their owne di≈øhonour in lo≈øing their fort. Neither was there any puni≈øhment for offences among the Vitelliani≈øts; on the other ≈øide the rewardes were apparent of tho≈øe that reuolted: ≈øo that from thence foorth the contention was, who ≈øhould bee mo≈øt traitour, and daily ≈øome of the Tribunes and Centurions fled to the enemie: for the common ≈øouldier was ob≈øtinately bent for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius, vntil Pri≈øcus and Alphenus Generalles for≈øaking the camp vpon feare, and returning to Vitellius, di≈øcharged the re≈øt from all blame of trea≈øon. About the ≈øame time Fabius Valens was put to death in the pri≈øon at Vrbine. His heade was openly ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Vitellian cohortes to put them out of all hope: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they beleeued that he was e≈øcaped into Germanie, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in armes both olde and newe ≈øouldiers there: but when they ≈øawe he was dead they beganne to de≈øpaire. The Flauian armie al≈øo tooke a wonderfull conceite as if his death were vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ende of the warre. Valens was borne at Anagnia, of a gentlemans hou≈øe, loo≈øe in conditions, and not without grace in ≈øeeking by wanton iea≈øtes the name of a plea≈øant conceite. In the games of Iuuenalia in Neroes time hee<note n="*" place="margin">Mimos acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavit.</note> plaied a part, fir≈øt as it were by compul≈øion, then voluntarily, with more dexteritie then credit. Being created Lieutenant of a Legion hee both ≈øought to preferre Verginius to the Empire, and then to di≈øcredit him. Fonteius Capito his Lieutenant generall, either becau≈øe hee was entred into trea≈øon, or becau≈øe he could not induce him to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, he murdred and made away. A traitour he was no doubt to Galba, and true to Vitellius, a vertue in him ≈øo much the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, becau≈øe ≈øo many others were fal≈øe. Now the Vitellian ≈øouldiers ≈øeeing all their hope cut off, going to yeelde them≈øelues to the contrary part, euen in that al≈øo had a care of their honour, and came downe into the plaine vnder Narnia vnder their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeignes and banners di≈øplaied: the Flauian army ≈øtoode armed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18156:84"/> with their weapons bent, as in battell, in thicke ranckes along the way ≈øide. So the Vitelliani≈øts were receiued into the middle, and being ≈øo inclo≈øed about, Antonius intertained them with comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and gracious wordes, and appointed ≈øome of them to abide at Narnia, and ≈øome at Interamna, leauing ≈øome of his owne Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions withall, without mole≈øtation to them if they were quiet, and yet of force ≈øufficient to repre≈ø≈øe them if they rebelled.</p>

So great a ≈øen≈øele≈øne≈ø≈øe had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed his minde, that if other men had not remembred, that he had beene once Prince, and therefore was not to looke for ≈øecurity in priuate e≈øtate, hee him≈øelfe would haue quickly forgotten it. But the principall men at Rome ≈øecretely incited Flauius Sabinus being Prouo≈øt of the citty, to put him≈øelfe into the cau≈øe, and vndertake part of the victory and of the honour: making remon≈øtrance vnto him, that the citty cohortes was his owne peculiare ≈øouldier, the cohortes of the Watchmen would que≈øtionle≈ø≈øe take his part, and their own retinue of bondmen ≈øhould bee at his di≈øpo≈øition, be≈øide the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the ≈øide, and the ea≈øy cour≈øe of proceeding they finde, that be in traine of winning. that hee ≈øhould not yeelde the honour of the action to Antonius and Varus: that Vitellius had but fewe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts in number, and tho≈øe di≈øcouraged and trembling at the euil newes that came out of all quarters: the common people was fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle &amp; changeable; &amp; if Sabinus would pre≈øent him≈øelfe for a head, they would v≈øe the ≈øame flattering termes for Ve≈øpa≈øian, which now they did to the other. as for Vitellius hee was a man not able to gouerne him≈øelfe in pro≈øperity, much le≈ø≈øe ≈øufficient to wielde and winde out of his declining e≈øtate: that the honour of fini≈øhing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18156:85"/> the warre would be his, who fir≈øt ≈øhould take po≈ø≈øe≈øsion of the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ≈øo were it fit in al congruity, both for Sabinus to re≈øerue the Empire to his brother, and for Ve≈øpa≈øian to e≈øteeme of all other mens ≈øeruice ≈øecundarily to Sabinus. The≈øe warlike ≈øpeeches made but a ≈ølender impre≈øsion in his feeble olde minde, and ≈øome did ≈øecretely ≈øu≈øpect and charge him, that through enuy and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hee ≈øought rather to hinder his brothers good fortune. For Flauius Sabinus was the elder brother, and exceeded Ve≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øian both in riches and authority, whiles they were both priuate men, and was thought to haue ≈øaued his credit, and kept him from breaking, by lending him money, but taking in morgage his hou≈øe and landes for repayment thereof: whereupon albeit in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ≈øhewe they continued frendes, yet ≈øome ≈øecrete ielou≈øies were feared betweene them. But the better interpretation was, that being a milde man he abhorred from ≈ølaughter and bloud, and therefore treated diuer≈øe times with Vitellius of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able compo≈øing of matters vpon conditions. And after diuer≈øe meetings at his hou≈øe, at the la≈øt a capitulation was concluded vpon (as the fame went) in the temple of Apollo, onely two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, Cluuius Rufus and Silius Italicus, beeing<note n="a" place="margin">Salutem ≈øibi &amp; millies HS. a Flauio Sabino Ve≈øpa≈øiani fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre pepigit, <hi>≈øai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> Suet.

Flauius Sabinus was be≈øet and taken, beeing neither armed, nor attempting to flee, and Quintius Atticus the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øull, a man of ≈øpeciall marke by rea≈øon of his office, and through his owne vanity and follie, hauing publi≈øhed edicts in honour of Ve≈øpa≈øian, and to the di≈øgrace of Vitellius. The re≈øt made ≈øundry ≈øhifts to e≈øcape, ≈øome in bondmens apparell, others were hidden by their clients, and conueyed away among≈øt the ≈øtuffe: ≈øome there were al≈øo that had learned the Vitelliani≈øts watch-worde; whereby one of them knewe another, and ≈øo a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and an≈øwering accordingly, v≈øed boldne≈ø≈øe in liew of a hole to lurke in. Domitian at their fir≈øt breaking in was hid in the ≈øex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens hou≈øe, and there by the pollicy of his freedman put in a linnen garment, as the mini≈øters of the temple did weare, and ≈øo e≈øcaped vnknowne, and lay ≈øecrete at the hou≈øe of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Primus, one of his fathers followers, neare to the Velabrum.

And as Vitellius pre≈øented him≈øelfe vppon the ≈øtayres of the palace to intreate for his life, they forced him in the end to de≈øi≈øt: then they ≈øtabbed and mangled him, and cutting of

He had ≈øerued in publicke place thirty fiue yeares, and was greatly renowned both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of peace and of warre: for integrity &amp; vpright dealing no man could touch him: ≈øomewhat he was too full of wordes; the only thing blamed in him during the ≈øeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> yeares that he ruled in Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia, &amp; the twelue yeares that he was prouo≈øt of the citty: in this la≈øt act of his life ≈øome iudged him cowardly, others moderate rather and ≈øparing of his citizens bloud; but of this all men agree that before Ve≈øpa≈øian was Prince, the reputation of the hou≈øe re≈øted in Sabinus.

Some are of opinion, that it was the purpo≈øe of all the Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders rather to put the citty in feare, then to ≈øeeke to take it by force, ≈øeeing the mo≈øt and principall cohortes had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linqui≈øhed Vitellius, and now all his ≈øtrength being cut off, it was likely he would re≈øigne the Empire without further coaction: but all that cour≈øe was cro≈ø≈øed, fir≈øt by Sabinus ha≈øt, and then through his cowardline≈ø≈øe; who ra≈øhly taking armes was not afterwarde able to keepe a fortre≈ø≈øe of that ≈øtrength, and which euen great armies could not haue taken, again≈øt three onely cohorts. But the fault cannot well bee imputed to one, which was common to all. For both Mutianus was ≈øome occa≈øion of ≈øtay, by meanes of his doubtfull letters, and Antonius by his prepo≈øterous obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in ≈øeeking to auoide enuy, de≈øerued great blame, and the other Commaunders pre≈øuming the warre to bee fini≈øhed, made the ende of it more notorious.

Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius came forward by the Flaminian way to Saxa rubra late in the night, &amp; too late to ≈øuccour.

For they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged him, that hee had ≈øuffred wilfully to ≈øcape from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gontiacum the cohortes of the Batauians, or rather purpo≈øelie ≈øent them away: that Ciuilis rebellious attempts were by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuence fo≈øtered, and by his meanes the Germans called to the party<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that neither Antonius Primus, nor Mutianus, had ≈øo ≈øtrengthened Ve≈øpa≈øians ≈øide, as Flaccus by this kinde of di≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling dealing: for open enemies and armes might openly and with armes be repelled, but fraude and deceite were matters hardly e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, &amp; therefore could not be auoided<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that Ciuilis ≈øtoode in the fielde embattelled again≈øt them, but Hordeonius out of his bed chamber gaue order, and directed as was mo≈øt for the enemies behoofe: and why then ≈øhould ≈øo many armed companies of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ≈øouldiers bee gouerned by a ≈øicke and ≈øeely olde man? nay why ≈øhould they not rather di≈øpatch ≈øuch a traitour, and free their fortune and vertue from the ill chance of ≈øo vnlucky a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? As they were in the≈øe ≈øpeeches one with another, letters came from Ve≈øpa≈øian which incen≈øed them more, the which Flaccus, becau≈øe hee could not conceale, cau≈øed openly to bee red before the a≈ø≈øembly, and ≈øent the bringers thereof bounde to Vitellius. By this meanes the ≈øouldiers mindes were ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what appea≈øed: and ≈øo they came to Bonna the ≈øtanding campe of the fir≈øt Legion: the ≈øouldiers whereof were more di≈øplea≈øed

Whereupon Hordeonius cau≈øed the coppies of all the letters, which he had ≈øent into France, Britannie and Spaine, reque≈øting their helpe, to be red to the army, and beganne a very ill example, that all letters ≈øent from abroade ≈øhould be deliuered to the ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd-bearers of the Legions, who red them to the ≈øouldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to the Generals hande.

                  <p>ABOVT the ≈øame time Lucius Pi≈øo Procon≈øull of Africke was ≈ølaine: the trueth of which murther I will briefly ≈øet downe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming fir≈øt certaine former matters, which may ≈øeeme to haue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtred chiefly occa≈øion, and cau≈øe to ≈øuch like inconueniences. The Legion in Africke, and the Aydes a≈øsigned to garde the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the Empire that way, in the time of Augu≈øtus, and Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, were vnder the gouernement of the Procon≈øull, till Caius a Prince of a troubled braine, and hauing in ielou≈øie M. Silanus,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18156:108"/> who then was Procon≈øull of Africke, remooued the Legion from the Procon≈øull, deliuering it to a Lieutenant ≈øent for that purpo≈øe. The parting of an office thus betweene two without ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, and their charge and points of commis≈øion lying intermingled, and running ioyntly together, bred and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed, as was intended, di≈øcorde and quarrels: and ≈øo through ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter emulation the Lieutenants office incroched and grew, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becau≈øe they continued longer in charge, or becau≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour per≈øons commonly take more payne, and delight in contending with their ≈øuperiours, the greate≈øt men of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øuls ≈øeeking rather ≈øafety then might. Now at this time Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Fe≈øtus was Lieutenant of the Legion there, a riotous youngman, and one that gaped after great matters, but much perplexed in minde, by rea≈øon he was ≈øo nearely allyed to Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. This Valerius in his often conferences which hee had with Pi≈øo, whether he per≈øwaded him to take vpon him the ≈øtate, or oppo≈øed him≈øelfe again≈øt Pi≈øoes ≈øolliciting it is vncertaine (for at their ≈øecrete communication none was pre≈øent be≈øide: and when Pi≈øo was ≈ølaine mo≈øt men inclined to fauour the ≈ølayer) certaine it is, that the prouince and ≈øouldiers were ill affected toward Ve≈øpa≈øian. And ≈øome of the Vitelliani≈øts e≈øcaping out of the Citty, layed downe before Pi≈øo the great pos≈øibility of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuating that purpo≈øe: that France was in termes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolting, Germanie readie to ≈øide them≈øelues with him, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the danger wherein hee ≈øtoode for his owne per≈øon, and that in a ≈øu≈øpected peace open warre was the onely ≈øafe cour≈øe. As the≈øe things were in doing, Claudius Sagitta captaine of the Petrin wing came thither, hauing out-≈øayled Papirius a Centurion ≈øent by Mutianus, and auowched that the ≈øayed Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion had commis≈øion to di≈øpatch Pi≈øo: that his kin≈øman and ≈øonne in lawe Galerianus was already di≈øpatched in Rome; ≈øo that the onely hope of ≈øafety con≈øi≈øted in venturing boldly: and of venturing there were but two waies, either ≈øtraight to take armes, or ≈øayling into France to offer him≈øelfe there for a head to the Vitellian armies. Notwith≈øtanding all which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations Pi≈øo per≈øi≈øted vnmooueable: and anone the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øent by Mutianus came; who, a≈ø≈øoone as he arriued at the porte of Carthage, proclaymed Pi≈øo Emperour, wi≈øhing to him as Prince all ≈øucce≈ø≈øe and pro≈øperity, and requiring all that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18156:109"/> hee met, being amazed at the wonder, to ioyne in the ≈øame crye. The credulous common people flocked in the market place and demanded the pre≈øence of Pi≈øo, filling the citty with ≈øhowts &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of ioy, partly vpon negligence to ≈øearch out the truth, and partly vpon a plea≈øure in flatterie. But Pi≈øo, whether vpon the intimation of Sagitta, or of his owne mode≈øty, refrained from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad &amp; committing him≈øelfe to the peoples di≈øcretion: &amp; examining the Centurion, perceiuing it was but a ≈ønare to entrap him, &amp; ≈øo to make him away, he commanded him to be ≈ølaine, not ≈øo much for hope of e≈øcaping him≈øelfe by ≈øo doing, as vpon iu≈øt indignation again≈øt the Centurion, becau≈øe the ≈øame man had beene one of the murtherers of Clodius Macer, &amp; ment to bring his hands lately embrued with the bloud of a Lieutenant now to the ≈ølaughter of a Procon≈øull. Then he checked the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians with a ≈øharpe and ≈øeuere edict, and cea≈øed to execute euen the v≈øuall points of his office, keeping ≈øtill within dores, le≈øt any occa≈øion of new commotion by mi≈øchance might ari≈øe. Fe≈øtus vnder≈øtanding how the people was daunted and da≈øhed, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion ≈ølaine, and other occurrencies part true, part fal≈øe, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and amplifyed, as fame feedeth in going, ≈øendeth certaine hor≈øemen to murther Pi≈øo; who making all ha≈øt in the dawning of the day brake into the hou≈øe of the Procon≈øull with drawen ≈øwordes, the mo≈øt part not knowing Pi≈øo by ≈øight, being Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of the cuntrey, and Moores picked out for the purpo≈øe. Whereupon meeting one of his ≈øeruants, not farre from his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, they asked him who he was, and where Pi≈øo was to be founde: the ≈øeruant perceyuing his ma≈øters danger, notably and re≈øolutely an≈øwered, that hee was Pi≈øo, and ≈øo was pre≈øentlie ≈ølaine in the place: by and by after Pi≈øo him≈øelfe was ma≈ø≈øacred.

Neuerthele≈ø≈øe neither did he ≈øwear, nor cau≈øed any Batauian to take the oath of France, tru≈øting in the ≈øtrength and a≈øsi≈øtance of the Germans, and if there ≈øhould happen hereafter contention to growe with the French a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Empire, accounting him≈øelfe both of more name &amp; abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Mummius Lupercus the Lieutenant of a Legion among other pre≈øents was ≈øent to Velleda, a virgin of the Bructerian nation, and queene ouer many cuntreyes: for ≈øo the olde maner of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans is, to beleeue many of their women to be prophete≈ø≈øes, and ≈øo, ≈øuper≈øtition increa≈øing, godde≈ø≈øes.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18156:114"/> and the Roman Legions ≈øhould be de≈øtroied. But Lupercus was ≈ølaine in the way: a few Centurions and Tribunes French borne were re≈øerued as a pledge of alliance and amity. The ≈øtanding campes of the cohortes, wings and Legions, were ouerthrowen and burned, tho≈øe onely excepted which were at Magontiacum and Vindoni≈ø≈øa. The ≈øixteenth Legion with the Auxiliaries, which at the ≈øame time yeelded them≈øelues, was commanded to departe from Noue≈øium to Triers, and a day ≈øet downe, before which they ≈øhould auoide the campe. The meane time was ≈øpent in ≈øundrie cares. Some of the cowardelie≈øt were terrified with the late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of them which were ≈ølaine at Vetera, in their i≈ø≈øuing out; the better ≈øort blu≈øhed for ≈øhame, to thinke of the infamous and di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable iourney, whom they mu≈øt follow for guides, and how al things ≈øhould bee at the ≈øimple plea≈øure and di≈øcretion of tho≈øe, whom they had made lords ouer their life and death: others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out re≈øpect of di≈øhonour packed about them money and ≈øuch things as were of mo≈øt price: others made ready their harne≈ø≈øe &amp; buckled them≈øelues to their weapons as though they were going to fielde. While they were thus mu≈øing, and ca≈øting their cards, the houre of remoue was come, more grieuous and dolefull then was imagined. For within the trench the deformity of the ≈øpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was not ≈øo apparent: the fielde and the day di≈øcouered the ≈øhame, the images of the Emperours being plucked out of their places, the en≈øeignes tied vp; whereas contrarily the French banners gli≈øtered and plaied on euery hande: in ≈øumme a ≈øilent &amp; ≈øorrowfull troupe, and as it were a long funerall pompe. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour Claudius Sanctus augmented the indignitie, one eied, ill fauoured in countenance, and weaker in wit. The di≈øhonour was doubled, when as the fir≈øt Legion relinqui≈øhing their campe at Bonna, vpon the like commandement adioined them≈øelues to the other: and the cuntreymen, that a little before quaked for feare at the very name of a Roman, when the fame of the Legions capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity was noi≈øed, ranne out of their hou≈øes, and fields from al quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to gaze and feede their eies with ≈øo ≈øtrange a ≈øight.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18156:128"/> reuoked by the generall rebellion of Britanny: but as in a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe not purpo≈øed before, ≈øhippes being wanting, the pollicy and re≈øolutene≈ø≈øe of the Captaine deui≈øed a pa≈ø≈øage, commanding the mo≈øt choi≈øe of the Aydes, to whom al the ≈øhallowes were knowen, and who after the v≈øe of their cuntrey were able in ≈øwimming to gouerne them≈øelues with armour and hor≈øes, laying a≈øide their cariage, to put ouer at once and ≈øodainly inuade them.

Thus Agricola at his fir≈øt entry into his prouince (which time others con≈øume in vaine o≈øten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation or ambitious ≈øeeking of ceremonies) entring withall into labours and dangers became famous indeede and of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

            <p>Now as touching his ciuill gouernement, Agricola knowing right well the di≈øpo≈øition and minde of the prouince, and taught al≈øo by experience of others, that armes auayle litle to ≈øettle a new conquered ≈øtate if iniuries and wrongs be permitted, determined to cut off all cau≈øes of warres and rebellions.

            <p>The fift yeare of the warre Agricola fir≈øt taking ≈øea went ouer, and ≈øubdued, with many and pro≈øperous conflicts, nations before that time vnknowen, and furni≈øhed with forces that part of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie, which lieth again≈øt Irelande, more in hope then for feare. For Irelande if it might haue beene wunne, lying betweene Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie and Spaine, and fitly al≈øo for the French ≈øea, would aptlie haue vnited, to the great aduantage of the one &amp; the other, the≈øe ≈øtronge≈øt members of the Empire togither. In bigne≈ø≈øe it is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Britannie, howbeit bigger then the ilandes of<note n="a" place="margin">He meaneth the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands there, as <hi>Sicilie.</hi> &amp;c.</note> our ≈øea. The ≈øoyle and temperature of the aire, the nature and fa≈øhions of the people, differ not much from the Britti≈øh. The portes and places of acce≈ø≈øe are more knowen, by rea≈øon of more frequenting of merchants. Agricola had receiued before a Prince of that cuntrey driuen out by ciuill di≈ø≈øen≈øion, whom vnder coulour of curte≈øie and frend≈øhip he retained till occa≈øion ≈øhould ≈øerue. I haue heard him oftentimes ≈øay, that with one Legion &amp; ≈øome fewe Aydes, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande might be wunne &amp; po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, and that it were al≈øo a ≈øtrength for our Britti≈øh affaires, if the Roman forces were planted ech-where, and liberty, as it were, bani≈øht out of ≈øight. Now in the ≈øommer, which beganne the ≈øixt yeare of his office, becau≈øe a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ri≈øing in armes of all the further nations beyonde Bodotria was feared, and pa≈ø≈øages were all be≈øet with the power of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he manned a fleete to ≈øearch the creekes and harboroughs of the ample region beyonde it, backing then fir≈øt of all with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy the re≈øt of his ≈øtrength, and with a goodly braue ≈øhewe bringing warre both by lande and by ≈øea. And oft ≈øo it chanced, that the hor≈øeman and footeman and the ≈øea ≈øoldier met, and made merry in the ≈øame campe, extolling &amp; magnifying ech their owne prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈ø≈øe and aduentures: making their vaunts and compari≈øons ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierlike, the one of the woods and high mountaines, the other of dangers of tempe≈øts and waues: the one of the lande and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, the other of the Ocean, ≈øubdued. The Britans, as by the pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners it was vnder≈øtoode, were amazed al≈øo at the ≈øight of the nauy, as though now the ≈øecrets of their ≈øea were di≈øclo≈øed, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge remained if they were ouercome. Whereupon the Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians arming with great preparation and greater fame, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is of matters vnknowen, a≈ø≈øayled our ca≈øtels as challengers,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18156:129"/> brauing and putting in feare: in≈øomuch that ≈øome of our ≈øide, which would ≈øeeme to bee wi≈øe being da≈øtards indeede, coun≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Generall to retire on this ≈øide Bodotria, and rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of his owne accorde, then to be repelled with ≈øhame. In the meane ≈øea≈øon Agricola hath knowledge, that the enemies ment to diuide them≈øelues, and to giue the on≈øet in ≈øeuerall companies. Whereupon le≈øt he ≈øhould be inclo≈øed about, &amp; intrapped by their multitude and skill in the cuntrey, he marched al≈øo with his army diuided in three. Which when it was knowen to the enemy, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging adui≈øe on the ≈øodayne, and vniting their forces togither, they ioyntly a≈ø≈øaulted by night the nienth Legion, as being of weake≈øt re≈øi≈øtance: and hauing ≈ølaine the watch, partly a≈øleepe &amp; partly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed with feare, brake into the campe. And now were they figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting within the trenches, when Agricola hauing vnder≈øtoode by ≈øpyes what way the enemies had taken, and following their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteppes, commandeth the lighte≈øt hor≈øemen and footmen to play on their backes and maintayne the skirmi≈øh, &amp; anone the whole army to ≈øhowte. And when it drew neare to be day, the glittering of the en≈øeignes was ≈øeene. So the Britans being quayled with a double danger, the Romans recouered courage againe, and being out of perill of their per≈øons, fought now for their honour; fre≈øhly a≈ø≈øayling their late a≈ø≈øaylers, &amp; driuing them to the gates: where in the ≈øtrayts the conflict was ≈øharpe &amp; cruell, till in the end the enemies were forced to flee, while≈øt both our armies conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the one to ≈øeeme to haue helped their fellowes, the other to haue needed none other to helpe them: and if the bogges and woods had not couered their flight, that victory had ended the warre. Vpon this battaile ≈øo manfully fought, ≈øo famou≈øly wunne, the army pre≈øuming that to their prowe≈ø≈øe all things were ea≈øy and open, cryed to leade into Caledonia, and to finde out the limit of Britannie with a cour≈øe of continuall conque≈øts: and tho≈øe which erewhile were ≈øo wary and wi≈øe, waxt forward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough after the euent, and grew to ≈øpeake bigly: ≈øuch is the hard condition of warres: if ought fall out well all challenge a part, misfortunes are onely imputed to one. Contrariwi≈øe the Britans pre≈øuppo≈øing that not valure, but the cunning of the Generall, by v≈øing the occa≈øion, had caried it away, abated no whit of their ≈øtomacke, but armed their youth, tran≈øported their children and wiues into places of ≈øafety, and ≈øought by a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblies
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18156:130"/> and religious rites to e≈øtabli≈øh an a≈ø≈øociation of the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties togither. And ≈øo for that yeare both parties departed incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed away.</p>
            <p>The ≈øame ≈øommer a cohort of V≈øipians, leuyed in Germanie, and ≈øent ouer into Britannie, committed a haynous and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable act. For hauing ≈ølaine a Centurion and certaine ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ≈øet ouer them for direction in di≈øcipline, they fled and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barcked them≈øelues in three ve≈ø≈øels, compelling the Ma≈øters by force to execute their charge: and onely one doing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the other two being ≈øu≈øpected and thereupon ≈ølaine, this ≈øtrange going out, the fact being yet not noy≈øed abroad, was gazed and wondred at. Afterward beeing driuen vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hither and thither, and a≈ø≈øayling the Britans which ≈øtoode in defence of their owne, often preuayling and ≈øometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øed, they came at the la≈øt to that mi≈øery, that they were enforced to eate one another, fir≈øt of the weake≈øt, then as the lot lighted. And thus floating about Britannie, and lee≈øing their ve≈ø≈øels for lacke of gouernement, they were intercepted fir≈øt by the Sueuians, and then by the Fri≈øians, as pyrats and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ≈øome of them being bought by merchants as ≈ølaues, and by change of ma≈øters brought to our ≈øide of the riuer, grew into a name by giuing fir≈øt notice of ≈øo great and ≈øo rare an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the ≈øommer Agricola was deepely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a grieuous mi≈øchance, which happened in his owne hou≈øe: for he lo≈øt his owne ≈øonne being about a yeare olde.

Therefore ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his nauy before, which by ≈øpoyling in ≈øundry places ≈øhould induce a greater and vncertainer terrour vpon them, hee made readie and followed him≈øelfe with his army, ioyning thereto ≈øome of the valiante≈øt Britans, whom by long experience in peace hee had found mo≈øt faithfull, and ≈øo arriued at the mount<note n="a" place="margin">Now called Grantzbaine.</note> Grampius, where the enemies were lodged before.

And le≈øt his arriuall at Rome ≈øhould bee noted, by rea≈øon of the multitudes of people which would goe out to ≈øee and to meete him, cutting off that curte≈øie of his frendes, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the cittie by night, and by night, as hee was willed, came
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18156:134"/> to the Palace. Where being admitted to the Princes pre≈øence, and receiued with a ≈øhort ≈øalutation and no ≈øpeech, hee ≈øorted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe with the re≈øt of the waiters. Now to the ende hee might temper and qualifie with other good parts his militare renowne, a vertue vnplea≈øant to men of no action, hee gaue him≈øelfe wholly to quietne≈ø≈øe and medling with nothing; being in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell moderate, affable in ≈øpeech, accompanied v≈øually but by one or two of his frendes: ≈øo that many, which commonly iudge of great men by the outwarde apparence and pompe, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and marking Agricola, mi≈ø≈øed of that which by ≈øame they conceyued, fewe aimed aright at the cau≈øe. Often was hee in tho≈øe dayes accu≈øed to Domitian in ab≈øence, and in ab≈øence acquitted. The cau≈øe was neither matter of crime, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of partie aggrieued, but the renowne of the man, and the Princes di≈øpo≈øition hating all vertue, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> the mo≈øt capitall kinde of enemies commenders, procured the perill. And in trueth tho≈øe times en≈øued in the ≈øtate, which would not ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Agricolaes name to bee buried in ≈øilence: ≈øo manie armies in Moe≈øia, Dacia, Germanie, Pannonia, eyther through the ra≈øhne≈ø≈øe or cowardline≈ø≈øe of the Generals ca≈øt awaie: ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good ≈øouldiers, with ≈øo manie cohortes defeated and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Neither was it the que≈øtion then for the vttermo≈øt boundes of the Empire and bancke of the Riuer, but the ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding campes of the Legions, and the prouinces them≈øelues were in danger of lee≈øing: ≈øo that lo≈ø≈øes beeing heapt vpon lo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and euerye yeare becomming notorious for ≈øome cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and ouerthrowe, Agricola was required by the ≈øpeech of the people for Generall, euerye man comparing his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, re≈øolutene≈ø≈øe, and experience in warre, with their in≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and da≈øtardly dealings: with which kinde of talke, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowen, Domitians eares were not vnacquainted; his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulle≈øt ≈øeruants vpon loue and alleageance, the re≈øt vpon ≈øpite and enuy pricking him forwarde, being of him≈øelfe prone to the wor≈øe. So Agricola partly through his owne vertues, and partlie the vices of others, was drawen headlong perforce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glorie. Now the yeare was at hande, whenas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øul≈øhippe of A≈øia or Africke ≈øhould bee allotted vnto him, and vpon the late murdering of<note n="a" place="margin">Suetonius Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiano. c. <hi>10.</hi> complures ≈øena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, in his ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot con≈øulares interemit, in quibus Ciuicam Cerealem in ip≈øo A≈øiae procon≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis.</note> Ciuica, neyther could Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian fayle of example to follow, nor Agricola of direction
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18156:135"/> what he ≈øhould doe. Some al≈øo priuy to the Princes ≈øecret intents offered ≈øpeech of them≈øelues, and asked him whether he could be content to accept of the gouernement: commending at the fir≈øt a farre off a quiet life and voide of bu≈øines, and proffering anone their mediation to the Prince to allow his excu≈øe. At the la≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their purpo≈øe in plaine termes, by per≈øwa≈øion and threats they induced him to become a direct ≈øuitour in that behalfe to Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitian: who ≈øetting a fained countenance vpon it, and compo≈øing him≈øelfe to keepe maie≈øty and ≈øtate, both heard his humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excu≈øing him≈øelfe from that charge, and when the excu≈øe was admitted ≈øuffred him≈øelfe to be ≈øolemnely thanked, and was not a≈øhamed of ≈øo odious a benefite. Howbeit the pen≈øion, which was woont to be offered to men of that quality, and by him had beene granted to certaine, he did not be≈øtowe vpon Agricola: either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended it was not ≈øued for, or vpon the guiltine≈ø≈øe of his owne con≈øcience, le≈øt thereby hee ≈øhould ≈øeeme to haue bought out<note n="a" place="margin">That is, his going into the prouince.</note> that thing, which he had forbidden. It is the property of mans nature to hate tho≈øe whom he hath hurted: be≈øide Domitian was prone and headlong to anger, and the more clo≈øe the more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable, yet was hee notwith≈øtanding altered and mollified by Agricolaes di≈øcretion and wary behauiour: for hee did not with ob≈øtinacy, nor vaine o≈øtentation of liberty, neither ha≈øten his fame nor his fall. Let them well knowe that are woont to admire tho≈øe things alone, which are done again≈øt the ≈øtreame of the time, that great men may be found euen vnder bad Princes; that dutifull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and mode≈øty, if indu≈øtry and valure bee ioyned, may attaine to that degree of prai≈øe and renowne, which ≈øome follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing dangerous cour≈øes haue a≈øpired vnto by an ambitious death, without any further profit at all.</p>
            <p>The ende of his life brought mourning to vs, and grieffe to his frends, and euen by ≈øtrangers and per≈øons vnknowen was lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the common ≈øort al≈øo, and this retchles people of ours, both came oft to his hou≈øe, and in all publicke places and meetings had it in ≈øpeech, neither did any per≈øon, when he heard of his death, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyce or ≈øodainly forget it. And that which procured the greater compa≈øsion was a con≈øtant report, that hee was made away by poy≈øon. Of mine owne knowledge I dare a≈ø≈øure nothing this onely, that during the time of his ≈øickne≈ø≈øe there came from Domitian, oftener then v≈øually are woont from Princes, who vi≈øit
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18156:135"/> by others, both of his ≈øecrete≈øt ≈øeruants &amp; neare≈øt phi≈øicians to ≈øee him, whether as of carefulnes, or onely to ≈øpie I leaue it vncertaine: certaine it is, that the day of his death, euery degree of his going away was caried in po≈øt to the Prince; and fewe men beleeued the news ≈øhould be ha≈øtened ≈øo much, that he would be ≈øory to heare. Notwith≈øtanding he made ≈øhewe of ≈øorrow in minde and in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, being now out of danger<note n="a" place="margin">That is, of the vertuous qualities of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola.</note> of that which hee hated, and one that more ea≈øily could di≈ø≈øemble his ioy then his feare. When Agricolaes te≈øtament was read, wherein hee made Domitian co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heire with his mo≈øt deare wife and mo≈øt duetifull daughter, it was certaine hee greatly reioyced thereat, as if it had beene a ≈øigne of honour, or proceeded of iudgement: ≈øo blinded hee was, and ≈øo greatly corrupted by continuall cu≈øtome of flatteries, that hee could not perceaue, that no good father did euer appoint for his heyre any Prince but a tyranne. Agricola was borne the thirteenth day of Iune, Caius Cae≈øar being third time Con≈øull, and dyed the<note n="b" place="margin">Fower and fiftieth, at the mo≈øt for from <hi>Caius Cae≈øar.</hi> 3. <hi>con≈ø.</hi> to <hi>Collegae</hi> and <hi>Pri≈øcus</hi> Con≈øuls were no more but fifty three yeares, but ≈øo is the fa≈øhion not only of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> but of other Hi≈øtory-writers, to mi≈ørecken in a maner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to the more.</note> ≈øix and fiftieth yeare of his age, the fower and twentieth day of Augu≈øt, Collega and Pri≈øcus beeing Con≈øuls.

And although hee died in the middle cour≈øe of his ripe age, in re≈øpect of honour and glory he liued with the longe≈øt: for of all the parts of true felicity, which con≈øi≈øteth in vertue, hee had fulfilled the mea≈øure: and hauing obtayned be≈øide Con≈øulare and triumphall ornaments, what more could fortune annexe to his e≈øtate? exce≈ø≈øe of riches he delighted not in; honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably hee had and according to his degree.
